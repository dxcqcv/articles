I just had my responsive images epiphany and I'm writing it all down before I forget everything. This is what I know…

Fixed size, varying density
If your image is a fixed size in pixels, but you want to cater for screens of different density, here's the solution:

<img alt="A cat" width="320" height="213" src="cat.jpg" srcset="cat-2x.jpg 2x, cat-3x.jpg 3x">
Fixed size, here or in CSS
This is used as the 1x src & by browsers that don’t support srcset
Image url
Pixel density of screen
This works in all modern browsers, and falls back to src in older browsers.

A few more rules, not covered in the image above:

Each item within srcset is <url> <density>x, eg cat-2x.jpg 2x
The order of items within the srcset doesn't matter
If you don't specify width/height, the browser will display the image at its native width/height divided by the density. Eg if the 2x resource is picked, it'll be rendered at 50% of the resources width/height
This is only a hint, even on a 3x device the browser may use the 1x image, perhaps due to poor connectivity
Live example
A cat
Varying size and density
Images of varying width are commonly used as part of the content on responsive sites. On this blog, content imagery takes up 100% of the article width, but the article isn't always 100% of the window.

In order for the browser to pick the right image, it needs to know:

URLs for the image at various sizes
The decoded width of each of those image resources
The width of the <img>
That last one is particularly tricky, as images start downloading before CSS is ready, so the width of the <img> cannot be detected from the page layout.

The key to understanding this syntax is knowing which of these values refer to the window width, the decoded image width, and the <img> width.

<img alt="A red panda eating leaves" src="panda-689.jpg" srcset="panda-689.jpg 689w,             panda-1378.jpg 1378w,             panda-500.jpg 500w,             panda-1000.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1066px) 689px,            (min-width: 800px) calc(75vw - 137px),            (min-width: 530px) calc(100vw - 96px),            100vw">
Only for browsers that don’t support srcset
Image url
Width of the image data
Width of the window
Width of the img elementwhen the condition matches
Fallback width, when no media conditions match
Via srcset, the browser knows the resources available and their widths. Via sizes it knows the width of the <img> for a given window width. It can now pick the best resource to load.

You don't need to specify density, the browser figure that out itself. If the window is 1066px wide or greater, we've signalled that the <img> will be 689px wide. On a 1x device the browser may download panda-689.jpg, but on a 2x device the browser may download panda-1378.jpg.

A few more rules, not covered in the image above:

Each item within srcset is <url> <width-descriptor>w, eg panda-689.jpg 689w
The order of items within the srcset doesn't matter
If srcset contains a width descriptor, the src is ignored by browsers that support srcset
Each item within sizes is <media-condition> <image-element-width>, except for the last entry which is just <image-element-width>
Both of the widths in sizes are in CSS pixels
The browser uses the first media condition match in sizes, so the order matters
As before, the browser may download a lower resolution image due to other factors such as poor connectivity
Picking which sizes to list is pretty straight forward. Start with your window at its narrowest, and as you increase its size, create a new rule whenever the <img> size vs window size changes formula.

When this window is at its narrowest, the <img> is full width, or 100vw. When the window goes beyond 530px the content area on this page gets 32px padding on the left and 64px on the right, so the <img> is now calc(100vw - 96px).

The browser won't call the police if it finds out you lied about the <img> width. I've been accurate with my sizes, but a rough answer can be good enough, eg sizes="(min-width: 1066px) 689px, (min-width: 800px) 75vw, 100vw".

Picking which resources to create and include in srcset is much harder, and I don't think I've mastered it. In the above example I include the maximum size the <img> can be (689px) and double that for 2x devices (1378px). The other two are rough in-between values. I didn't include smaller widths such as 320px, under the assumption that screens of that size will be 2x density or greater.

srcset + sizes works in Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. For other browsers, it'll safely fall back to src. You don't have to wait long for better support here, it's in WebKit nightly & will appear in the next stable version of Edge.

Live example
A red panda eating leaves
Varying width, density, and art direction
Similar to the previous example, but the framing changes at different widths. This allows you to focus in on the subject at smaller widths.

<picture>  <source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="f1-focused-800.jpg 800w,                  f1-focused-1406.jpg 1406w" sizes="(min-width: 530px) calc(100vw - 96px),                 100vw">  <img alt="F1 car in the gravel" src="f1-689.jpg" srcset="f1-689.jpg 689w,               f1-1378.jpg 1378w,               f1-500.jpg 500w,               f1-1000.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1066px) 689px,              calc(75vw - 137px)"></picture>
If this query matches the window, use these to select the src
…else use these
You can have as many <source>s as you want
You must include an <img>
The media query on <source> will always be obeyed, it's not just a hint
The media query is based on the window's width, not the <img>
The first matching <source> will be used, so the order matters
If no matching <source> is found, the <img> is used
The <img> must appear after all <source>s
<source> doesn't support src, but srcset="whatever.jpg" works just as well
Once the <source> or <img> is selected, the srcset and sizes attributes work as in previous examples, so you can mix and match techniques.

The <picture> element works in Chrome, Firefox, and Opera, and falls back to the <img> in other browsers. I'm told it might make it into the next release of Edge, which is nice.

Live example
 F1 car in the gravel
Varying on type
This method allows you to serve better-optimised formats to browsers that support them.

<picture>  <source type="image/webp" srcset="snow.webp">  <img alt="Hut in the snow" src="snow.jpg"></picture>
If this type is supported, use this
…else this
type is a mime type
You can have multiple sources and mix type with media, srcset, and even sizes to create something truly monstrous/awesome
This works in Chrome, Firefox, and Opera, and falls back to the <img> in other browsers.

Live example
 Hut in the snow
