We all know that the best way to learn a language is to talk to native speakers. That's why we are all here on this website, but sometimes, it's not possible to speak with natives; we don't live in our target language country, we don't have an Internet connection, we are sick of sitting at a computer for hours, we need to go for a run, we have to go to work, etc.



我们都知道学习语言最好的方法就是和以此为母语的人交谈。因此我们会在这里用这个网站。不过有时候，不是都有机会和他们交谈。我们没有住到说那种语言的国家去，有时候网络不通，坐在电脑前数小时，也需要出去跑跑步，而且我们还要工作等等。

But we can keep on learning and absorbing language during the time that we aren't engaging with native speakers. Make sentences up in your head while walking to work. Write short stories, make friends with Google Translate. Here are some more ideas to help you continue to learn your target language when you're alone.

不过即使我们不跟说母语的朋友们交谈，我们还是可以继续学习和吸取语言方面的知识。比如在上班路上默默在脑中造几句句子，写个小故事，勾搭勾搭谷歌翻译。下面我会跟大家介绍一些方法，即便你一个人还是能继续学外语。

Put it in context
把语言用到生活中去

The best thing you can do for your language learning is to put it in context--make it natural. Step away from the computer (unless you are using italki to speak to native speakers), and use your language in the real world, even if that world doesn't speak your target language.

学语言最好的方法就是活学活用，用得更自然自在。别老在电脑前学了（除非你在用italki和老外交流）。即便在这里没人跟你说外语，也要把外语用到现实生活中去。

For example, if you have to write an email for work, after you've written it, sit down and try and write it in your target language. You'll be using language in a way that is natural to you, writing about the kinds of things you would normally write about. The same goes for your reading or listening. Read and listen to things you are interested in already. In this way, your attention is already caught. If you like cycling, for instance, search for cycling material in your target language.

要写一封工作邮件，写完了再想想是不是可以用你学的那种外语试着写写。用最自然的方式运用外语，写点你常写的各种东西。这样的方法同样适用于阅读和听力。听听和读读你感兴趣的东西。这样的话，你注意力就会更集中。如果你喜欢骑自行车，搜一点外语写的自行车材料。

Flash cards
单词卡片

Memorizing new vocabulary is hard. It doesn't seem to matter how often you look at those flash cards; the new words just don't stick! Flash cards can be useful--you can spend a lot of effort trying to memorize a lot of words, but don't actually seem to retain much. Many language experts suggest that learning a language subconsciously is a better way to learn. It is, after all, how babies learn.

学习新单词很难。其实花多长时间看单词卡片没什么用，新单词就是记不住。单词卡片可能会有点效果，花很多精力去记忆这么多词汇，但时间久了还是记不住。很多专家都指出潜意识学习语言更好。毕竟这种方法就是婴儿学说话的方法。

Focusing on your learning could actually slow the process down. Staring furiously at flash cards trying to absorb the information is hard work. How about giving yourself the space to absorb the new language in a more natural, even subconscious way?

专注于学习有可能会学得更慢。眼珠把单词卡片戳穿，能记多少几多少也挺难的。不如给自己一点空间，用更自然更潜意识的方法去学新的语言？

Use Post-it notes to put your new vocabulary into context (this is a great one for beginners), and stick them to the actual object you are trying to remember. Then it really starts to take hold. This is great for learning household items. Use a dictionary to translate from your language into your target language. Write it down on a Post-it note (sometimes, a scrap of paper with sticky tape works better) and stick it onto the object you need to learn. Stick it onto the bed, door, wall, fridge, table, etc. if you can, stick them onto objects at your workplace, too.

用即时贴提醒自己把词汇用到语境中去（初学者最适合的方法），并贴在要学的新单词上。之后就真的记住这个单词了。这种方法最适合学习居家用品了。找一本字典翻译下，把单词写到即时贴上（一张纸和胶带也行），再把即时贴到真正的物品上。贴到床上、门上、墙上、冰箱上和桌子上等等。如果可以的话，在办公的地点贴也行。

As you walk through your home, the note will catch your eye and it will trigger your memory because it puts the learning of those words into a more subconscious natural state. Every time your eye glances over the Post-it note, the word will lodge a bit further into your brain. You aren't forcing yourself to remember the words, and as most of us know, forcing ourselves to learn something doesn't result in much, and definitely isn't fun.

走在家里，这些小纸条会引起你的注意，激发你的记忆力，因为学这些单词的环境更自然，潜意识里记得更牢。每次你目光瞟过即时贴，单词在你脑海里印得更深。你并没有逼迫自己强记单词。我们都知道强迫自己学习效果不好，而且也不好玩。

Learning new words in isolation gives you nothing to make associations with. If we can associate a new word with its surrounding language, it will mean more to us, making it more familiar and it will stick that much easier. When writing flashcards, always write an example of when or how to use the word on the back of the card. Don't memorize the definition of the word or the word by itself. Instead, memorize the use of the word. For example:

新单词一个个学的话就很难引发联想。如果我们可以将单词和其相关语境联系起来，这样对我们的意义也就更大，增加亲切感，记得也更牢。写单词卡片的时候，在背后一定要写上一个例句和单词的用法。别光记单词的意思或仅仅单词本身，记词用法。例如：

新单词：kick



Definition: to strike with the foot or feet:
Usage: “He kicked the ball,” “She kicked her brother”
Write “kick” on one side and the usage on the other. Adding a photo of someone kicking a ball will help or even better, draw a picture in your mind!



定义：用一只脚（或以上）踢：
用法：“他踢了这个球”，“她踢了她的哥哥或弟弟”
在卡片的正面写kick这个单词，反面写上用法。最好附上某人踢球的照片，脑海里要有这么一幅图。



Get tactile - Don't be afraid to draw!
调动感官：最好多画画！

The very process of physically making marks with a pen on paper helps to access your right brain, which is what enables us to make memories and to focus. You don't have to be good at drawing to make a useful illustration that will help you remember. All you need is a stick figure performing the action, or a simple drawing of the object.

用一支笔在纸上涂涂画画这个过程会激发右脑，从而触发记忆力和集中注意力。就是画的不怎么样也能帮助你记忆。你只需要画个简笔画，或者画一个简单的物体也好。

Remember playing Pictionary? Try drawing a more difficult concept as you would have done in a Pictionary game. Try to make it as easy as possible for someone else to guess what it is.

还记不记得玩看图说词？玩这个游戏的时候试着画出你脑中比较复杂的想法。给别人猜的时候要尽量想的简单一些。

The process of drawing your word or phrase will help keep it in your head. Draw new words and visualize them, using your drawings. If you are learning a language with a different alphabet, draw the characters or letters in the sand while you are on holiday or in your kid's sandbox, whatever works!

把单词和词组画在纸上，这个过程帮助你记忆。新单词，用你画的图可视化下。如果你学的语言所用的字母和你的母语很不一样，放假的时候在沙子里或者沙盒里写字，只要管用都行！

If we open up more of our senses to our language learning and involve touch, as well as sight and sound, we embed the information into our brains in different ways at the same time, thus making it easier to retain. Why do we learn language faster when we are immersed in the culture? Because all our senses are engaged! So when we don't have the culture to immerse ourselves in, we can still try to engage our other senses.

如果在学习外语的时候打开更多的感官，包括触觉、视觉和听觉，接受信息的时候我们的头脑会同时以不同的方式记忆，这样信息就能停留地更久。为什么我们身处在外语文化的情况下外语学得更好？因为我们所有的感官都调动起来了！当我们没有这种环境的时候，就要使劲调动其他感官。

write a short text based on your notes
根据时贴上的笔记，写一小段故事

Storytelling can benefit language learning. After all, that's how our ancient ancestors learned and passed on their language and culture through stories round the campfire. Make stories or short texts out of your new language. It helps put it in context, and as we know, context makes it stick.

说故事对学语言是很有帮助的。毕竟，我们的祖先就是围坐在篝火旁，一边讲故事一边传承他们的语言和文化的。用新学的外语编一个故事或者短文。帮助我们创造一个语境，也就加强了记忆。

Here's how: Photograph everyday scenes around your home or on your way to work, print them out and write the Post-it note on them. Write about what you see in your photos. For example, if you take a photo from your bedroom window, you could write: From my bedroom window, I can see cars on the road, trees and houses, people in the distance and beyond them, mountains and sky.”

具体可以这么做：拍下每天你在家里和上班时候出现的场景，打印出来，把即时贴贴在上面。在照片上写下所看所想。譬如你拍了张你家卧室窗的照片，你可以写下：从我卧室的窗边，可以看到路上的汽车、树、房子，远处的人们还有更远的地方有山和天空。

To raise the level, add descriptive words to your existing text. For example: “From my bedroom window, I can see cars on the potholed road, trees still bare in the fresh spring breeze waving their branches, houses trickling thin plumes of smoke from their chimneys, two people in the distance chatting about something funny, and beyond them, snowy mountains and a clear blue sky.”

要再进一步的话，多加一些描述性的语言。像这样：“从我的卧室窗前，我可以看见坑坑洼洼的道路，树木还是光秃秃的，一缕春风吹过，枝桠摇晃了起来，房屋的烟囱炊烟袅袅，远处，有两人好像在聊什么好玩儿的事儿，再向远处望去，便是绵延的雪山和清冷的蓝天。”

Talk to yourself (in your head)
在脑中跟自己说话

After you've had a conversation with someone, ask yourself how you would have said it in your target language. Or just before you are about to speak with someone, ask yourself how you might say it in your target language. This way, you are thinking about speaking in a way natural to you about subjects you are familiar with and likely to want to talk about in your target language. Then go to Google Translate--or preferably italki, as Google Translate does vocabulary well, but not so well with grammar. Write down what you would have said, and ask people and/or Google to translate it to see how close you were.

在你和别人交谈后，或者在跟别人对话之前，扪心自问对话怎么用外语说。这样一来，你就用外语在思考，用你最自然的方式对自己谈论熟悉或者可能要谈论的话题。接下来去谷歌翻译，最好还是italki，尽管谷歌翻译词汇翻译挺好，但语法不怎么样。写下你要说的话，问问老师或者让谷歌翻一下，看看对不对。

One thing to note with Google Translate is it's great to use it like a dictionary, but remember that its grammar and phrase recognition isn't perfect yet, so italki is still a better way to find out how close you were.

需要主要的是谷歌翻译可以把它当做词典来用，不过其语法和词作辨识能力还不完美，所以用italki检查更好

Quality, not quantity
重质量而非数量

If you were using Anki or a similar flash card app, you might spend all day learning 20 words and only remember one, but if you choose only one word to start with and practice using it in context, you've not only remembered a word but you've practiced the surrounding vocabulary associated with that word.

如果你在使用Anki或者类似的单词记忆软件，可能你整天也就学了20个单词最后还只记住一个。如果你起初从学一个单词开始，把它放入到语境之中，你不仅学到了单词，还在相关的语境中用到了这个单词。

Try to find as many ways as you can in one day to use the word, even if you are having conversations in your head. For example: Take the word busy. As you go about your day, use the word busy in context. When you are cooking, say to yourself, “I'm too busy to cook, I should get take-out.” Or when you go grocery shopping, you could say to yourself, “This store is really busy, I'm going to come back later.”

在一天里尽可能找到各种方法去用这个单词，甚至可以自己和自己对话。举个例子，你要学busy（忙）这个词，把它放到生活中去。你在烧菜的时候，自己对自己说，“我快忙到没时间烧菜了，我应该叫外卖。”或者如果你去杂货店买东西，你可以自己对自己说，“这个店好繁忙，我一会儿再过来买。”

If you don't know the target language, just drop the new word into your native language. This will help you remember the word in context. It's not perfect, but it's better than just learning a list of words that have no associations. For example, learning the French word for busy when you don't know what the surrounding language is, you could just say, “I'm too occupé to cook.” You are learning the word in context; the rest of the language will come.

如果你不懂整句句子的外语，那就用母语造句好了。这也能帮助你记住单词。虽然方法不十全十美，但至少比你背一长串单词没有任何联想好。在法语中busy这个单词，如果你不知道完整的造句怎么造，那你就用你的母语夹杂带入就好：“我太occupé（法语的“忙”）都没时间烧饭。”你是在语境中学习；其余不会说的也慢慢学会的。

Keep it simple
简单是王道

Language learning can get complicated pretty quickly, especially if you are focusing on language grammar rather than language production. I always encourage my students to speak as much as they can and not fear mistakes. If your grammar is wrong but I understand you, then we have communicated effectively and that is the main thing.

学外语可能在短时间内就会变得复杂起来，尤其在你注重语法而非语言输出的时候。我总是鼓励我的学生尽可能多开口，别害怕出错。如果语法错了，但我听懂了，交际也就成功，这才是最重要的一点。

Studying grammar is a big turnoff for some people. Native English speakers especially shy away from language learning due to their bad experience with boring grammar drills at school. Language learners from other countries seem to do so much better because they have learned English not only through school but also through watching their favorite movies and listening to music in English.

有些人对语法一窍不通。就算英美母语人士也会对语法躲之不及，他们觉得在学校学得语法很无聊。其他地方的外语学习者好像对语法这方面很在行，他们在学校里面学语法，课堂外也通过看最喜欢的电影、听音乐学习英语。

There are hundreds of apps and websites that can make your language learning easier and fun. Some of them are quite in depth--you have to sign up, be involved in the community, etc. So try a website that offers only one service. The following great websites are a lot of fun, and can help with memorizing your vocabulary.

有成百上千个app和网站帮助你学外语，让学习变得更有趣。其中一些要求的参与度挺高的，你要注册还要加入网上社区等。所以试试只提供一种服务的网站。虾米的网站很好玩，也能帮助你单词。

Babadum lets you guess or test your vocabulary knowledge. It also gives you great ideas for flash cards, and you can draw your own flash cards based on the drawings you see on the website. You can also test yourself in different ways, using pictures or just words to make it harder. Although memorizing lists of words is not the best way to retain the language, what Babadum does do is allow you to see patterns in words and their relation to your own language. You'll find yourself knowing the answer without really knowing why, then you'll start to realize that there's a lot in your own language that can give you clues about your target language. However, this is only true of languages that use the same alphabet, or are all Latin languages, for example.

Babadum让你猜单词，测试你的单词知识。你也能从中获取许多单词卡片的内容，你可以根据网站上的生词卡片画你自己的卡片。你也可以用各种方法给自己做测试，用图片或者单词，增加难度。尽管记一长串单词表不是语言记忆的最好方式，Babadum可以让你看见词的规律，并且同你的母语建立联系。虽然你并不怎么知道为什么，但你可能就会知道答案，根据你的母语，许多地方都可以在外语中找到对应线索。不过，这只针对两种使用相同字母表的语言，或者都是拉丁语系的语言。

Vidtionary is a great resource for creating a concept/visualization around your new word. If you can memorize the word via concept or visualization it will help it stick in your head. Here's how it works: click on a word and watch the visual definition of that word, memorize the visual definition along with the word. For example, the word reflection shows images of clouds reflecting in the glass walls of buildings, the sun reflecting on the water, etc. Think about these images in your head when you are thinking about your new word.

如果你要创造情境，视觉化学单词，Vidtionary是个不错的资源，可以让你单词记得更久。具体它是这样用的：点击一个单词，观看一段视频解释这个单词，从视觉上记忆单词内容。比如reflection（倒影）这个单词，它就会有云在玻璃墙上的倒影，太阳在水中的倒影等等。想新单词的时候想想这些脑海中的图片吧。

The Lyrics Training website lets you choose your language and then listen to music in that language. This is a great way to subconsciously absorb the language as you work, or work out, or whatever else it is you are doing that means you can't focus on your language learning.

The Lyrics Training 网站可以让你选择不同语言的歌曲。这样你可以在上班、健身任何时候潜意识地学习语言，不能集中思想的时候也能学了。

I'm sure we've all been on YouTube searching for movies and video clips in our target language, but here's a tip: if the movie has closed captioning, turn it on. Listening to and reading your target language at the same time can be helpful, and it's a lot more productive than listening in your target language and reading subtitles in your native language. If you are reading subtitles in your native language, you'll block out the target language conversation while you concentrate on your own language. If you listen and read in your target language, your brain will be using two skills to help you understand, so you'll get it quicker.

你肯定在YouTube上搜索外语电影视频的片段，教你一个窍门：如果电影有内置字幕的话就打开看字幕。一边听一边看外语很有效，而且比你听外语但是看母语的字幕有用多了。如果你看的是你母语的字幕，因为你注意力会在母语上，外语对话就不过脑子了。如果你一边听一边看外语，你脑子就会同时调动听和读两项技能，学得也就更快。



And so there we have it--seven tips to help you learn alone. Some might work better for others. Try them all out, and see which ones work best for you. And don't forget your brain is always open, soaking up new things, even when you aren't focusing. Sometimes the best time to learn is when we're relaxed and not trying too hard!

现在7大诀窍都掌握了吧，即使一个人也能学得好。把上面的方法都试试，必有一款适合你。别忘了你的大脑时时刻刻都运作，接受新事物，即使你思想不集中的时候。有时候学习的最佳时间反而是我们最放松，不怎么努力的时候。
