The RICG is about to tackle Element Queries. To prepare for this imminent broadening of our scope of work, we’re doing some housekeeping:

It’s official! We’re now the Responsive Issues Community Group
We’ve got a new website, and it lives at ricg.io. It’s a bit sparse at the moment but it’s a work in progress.
Element Queries are a GHOULd idea! But it’s still very, very early days; to draft a use cases document, SPOOKification, and ultimately bring them to browsers we’ll need all the help we can get. ContriBOOte!

image-spook()
A week ago Jason Grigsby asked, “what ever happened to image-set()?” image-set() brings srcset’s functionality to CSS; Jason does a great job of explaining why we need it in a subsequent blog post. image-set() was implemented with a prefix in WebKit two years ago (!) and then we all kind of... forgot about it.

The discussions that came out of Jason’s post were productive. image-set() is happening; it’ll be specced as a part of CSS Images Level 3, it’s going to have feature parity with HTML’s respimg features, and the RICG is going to push for it however we can. TERRORiffic!

Boo!-link
Yoav’s respimg implementation in Blink is already shipping, but that doesn’t mean it’s done. Some changes made over the last couple of weeks:

Blink now uses gemetric means to pick srcset sources. What in the HELL does that mean? Blink used to pick the smallest source that supplied at least as many pixels as it needed; now it picks the source whose dimensions are the closest to what it needs. For example: before, given an option between two resources, one with 0.9x the image’s device pixel width and the other with 3x, Blink would have picked the 3x source; now it’ll compromise a little bit on sharpness and save a lot of bytes by selecting the 0.9x resource.

Different browsers are going to do different things here. With any luck, they’ll continue to experiment with, refine, and ultimately improve their srcset picking logic over time. Developers can’t predict which source will be chosen out of a srcset, and that’s a good thing. “srcset is about letting go”.

Blink also now avoids downloading smaller images if bigger ones are already available in the cache. So, now, shrinking your browser window (or changing the orientation of your phone from landscape to portrait) won’t trigger a new request for a new resource; Blink will happily continue to scale-down the old, larger one. A clear and obvious win!

Lastly, Blink now gives developers console warnings about bad srcset descriptors. Helping you EXORCISE bugs.

Yay! Link!
The video from Wilto’s excellent talk at Refresh Boston is up and it is chock full o’ Zelda references.

Tricks and treats
There’s been no SCAREcity of respimg links over the last two weeks:

Picturefill 2.2 hit beta. The new version brings better spec compliance, better performance, fewer bugs, and it plays nicely with Asynchronous Module Definitions.

The NCC Group broke Betteridgde’s Law of Headlines by asking, “Is it time to start using srcset and the picture element?”

Eiji Kitamura published a bit of Javascript that uses Service Workers (which were just green-lighted in Blink) to manipulate image requests based on a global manifest. Yoav asks, “who will write the tool that does the same thing server-side?”

See you in a couple of weeks!
