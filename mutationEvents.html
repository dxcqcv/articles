Mutation events

Deprecated
This feature has been removed from the Web. Though some browsers may still support it, it is in the process of being dropped. Do not use it in old or new projects. Pages or Web apps using it may break at any time.

Mutation events provide a mechanism for a web page or an extension to get notified about changes made to the DOM. Use Mutation Observers instead if possible.
Preface

The mutation events have been marked as deprecated in the DOM Events specification, as the API's design is flawed (see details in the "DOM Mutation Events Replacement: The Story So Far / Existing Points of Consensus" post to public-webapps).

Mutation Observers are the proposed replacement for mutation events in DOM4. They are expected to be included in Firefox 14 and Chrome 18.

The practical reasons to avoid the mutation events are performance issues and cross-browser support.
Performance

Adding DOM mutation listeners to a document profoundly degrades the performance of further DOM modifications to that document (making them 1.5 - 7 times slower!). Moreover, removing the listeners does not reverse the damage.

The performance effect is limited to the documents that have the mutation event listeners.
Cross-browser support

These events are not implemented consistently across different browsers, for example:

    IE prior to version 9 didn't support the mutation events at all and does not implement some of them correctly in version 9 (for example, DOMNodeInserted)
    WebKit doesn't support DOMAttrModified (see webkit bug 8191 and the workaround)
    "mutation name events", i.e. DOMElementNameChanged and DOMAttributeNameChanged are not supported in Firefox (as of version 11), and probably in other browsers as well.
    ...

Dottoro documents browser support for mutation events.
Mutation events list

The following is a list of all mutation events, as defined in DOM Level 3 Events specification:

    DOMAttrModified
    DOMAttributeNameChanged
    DOMCharacterDataModified
    DOMElementNameChanged
    DOMNodeInserted
    DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument
    DOMNodeRemoved
    DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument
    DOMSubtreeModified

Usage

You can register a listener for mutation events using element.addEventListener as follows:

element.addEventListener("DOMNodeInserted", function (ev) {
  // ...
}, false);

The event object is passed to the listener in a MutationEvent (see its definition in the specification) for most events, and MutationNameEvent for DOMAttributeNameChanged and DOMElementNameChanged.

MutationObserver

MutationObserver provides developers a way to react to changes in a DOM. It is designed as a replacement for Mutation Events defined in the DOM3 Events specification.
Constructor
MutationObserver()

Constructor for instantiating new DOM mutation observers.

new MutationObserver(
  function callback
);

Parameters

callback
    The function which will be called on each DOM mutation. The observer will call this function with two arguments. The first is an array of objects, each of type MutationRecord. The second is this MutationObserver instance.

Instance methods
void observe( Node target, MutationObserverInit options );
void disconnect();
Array takeRecords();
observe()

Registers the MutationObserver instance to receive notifications of DOM mutations on the specified node.

void observe(
  Node target,
  MutationObserverInit options
);

Parameters

target
    The Node on which to observe DOM mutations.
options
    A MutationObserverInit object, specifies which DOM mutations should be reported.

NOTE: Adding an observer to an element is just like addEventListener, if you observe the element multiple times it does not make a difference. Meaning if you observe element twice, the observe callback does not fire twice, nor will you have to run disconnect() twice. In other words, once an element is observed, observing it again with the same observer instance will do nothing. However if the callback object is different it will of course add another observer to it.
disconnect()

Stops the MutationObserver instance from receiving notifications of DOM mutations. Until the observe() method is used again, observer's callback will not be invoked.

void disconnect();

takeRecords()

Empties the MutationObserver instance's record queue and returns what was in there.

Array takeRecords();

Return value

Returns an Array of MutationRecords.
MutationObserverInit

MutationObserverInit is an object which can specify the following properties:
NOTE: At the very least, childList, attributes, or characterData must be set to true. Otherwise, "An invalid or illegal string was specified" error is thrown.
Property 	Description
childList 	Set to true if additions and removals of the target node's child elements (including text nodes) are to be observed.
attributes 	Set to true if mutations to target's attributes are to be observed.
characterData 	Set to true if mutations to target's data are to be observed.
subtree 	Set to true if mutations to not just target, but also target's descendants are to be observed.
attributeOldValue 	Set to true if attributes is set to true and target's attribute value before the mutation needs to be recorded.
characterDataOldValue 	Set to true if characterData is set to true and target's data before the mutation needs to be recorded.
attributeFilter 	Set to an array of attribute local names (without namespace) if not all attribute mutations need to be observed.
MutationRecord

MutationRecord is the object that will be passed to the observer's callback. It has the following properties:
Property 	Type 	Description
type 	String 	Returns attributes if the mutation was an attribute mutation, characterData if it was a mutation to a CharacterData node, and childList if it was a mutation to the tree of nodes.
target 	Node 	Returns the node the mutation affected, depending on the type. For attributes, it is the element whose attribute changed. For characterData, it is the CharacterData node. For childList, it is the node whose children changed.
addedNodes 	NodeList 	Return the nodes added. Will be an empty NodeList if no nodes were added.
removedNodes 	NodeList 	Return the nodes removed. Will be an empty NodeList if no nodes were removed.
previousSibling 	Node 	Return the previous sibling of the added or removed nodes, or null.
nextSibling 	Node 	Return the next sibling of the added or removed nodes, or null.
attributeName 	String 	Returns the local name of the changed attribute, or null.
attributeNamespace 	String 	Returns the namespace of the changed attribute, or null.
oldValue 	String 	The return value depends on the type. For attributes, it is the value of the changed attribute before the change. For characterData, it is the data of the changed node before the change. For childList, it is null.
Example usage

The following example was taken from this blog post.

// select the target node
var target = document.querySelector('#some-id');
 
// create an observer instance
var observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) {
  mutations.forEach(function(mutation) {
    console.log(mutation.type);
  });    
});
 
// configuration of the observer:
var config = { attributes: true, childList: true, characterData: true };
 
// pass in the target node, as well as the observer options
observer.observe(target, config);
 
// later, you can stop observing
observer.disconnect();
