Where to use it
Moment was designed to work both in the browser and in Node.js.

Currently the following browsers are used for the ci system: IE8, IE9 on Windows 7, stable Chrome on Windows XP, Safari 10.8 on Mac and stable Firefox on Linux.

All code will work in both environments. All unit tests are run in both environments.

Node.js

edit
npm install moment
var moment = require('moment');
moment().format();
Note: In 2.4.0, the globally exported moment object was deprecated. It will be removed in next major release.

Browser

edit
<script src="moment.js"></script>
<script>
    moment().format();
</script>
Moment.js is available on cdnjs.com. Remember though, cool kids concatenate their scripts to minimize http requests.

Bower

edit
bower

bower install --save moment
Notable files are moment.js, locale/*.js and min/moment-with-locales.js.

Require.js

edit
require.config({
    paths: {
        "moment": "path/to/moment",
    }
});
define(["moment"], function (moment) {
    moment().format();
});
Moment will still create a moment global, which is useful to plugins and other third-party code. If you wish to squash that global, use the noGlobal option on the module config.

require.config({
    config: {
        moment: {
            noGlobal: true
        }
    }
});
If you don't specify noGlobal then the globally exported moment will print a deprecation warning. From next major release you'll have to export it yourself if you want that behavior.

For version 2.5.x, in case you use other plugins that rely on Moment but are not AMD-compatible you may need to add wrapShim: true to your r.js config.

Note: To allow moment.js plugins to be loaded in requirejs environments, moment is created as a named module. Because of this, moment must be loaded exactly as as "moment", using paths to determine the directory. Requiring moment with a path like "vendor\moment" will return undefined.

Note: From version 2.9.0 moment exports itself as an anonymous module, so if you're using only the core (no locales / plugins), then you don't need config if you put it on a non-standard location.

Troubleshooting

edit
If you are having any troubles, try asking a question on Stack Overflow with the momentjs tag.

You can also use the GitHub issue tracker to find related issues or open a new issue.

Parse
Instead of modifying the native Date.prototype, Moment.js creates a wrapper for the Date object. To get this wrapper object, simply call moment() with one of the supported input types.

The Moment prototype is exposed through moment.fn. If you want to add your own functions, that is where you would put them.

For ease of reference, any method on the Moment.prototype will be referenced in the docs as moment#method. So Moment.prototype.format == moment.fn.format == moment#format.

Now 1.0.0+

edit
moment();
To get the current date and time, just call moment() with no parameters.

var now = moment();
This is essentially the same as calling moment(new Date()).

String 1.0.0+

edit
moment(String);
When creating a moment from a string, we first check if the string matches known ISO 8601 formats, then fall back to new Date(string) if a known format is not found.

var day = moment("1995-12-25");
Warning: Browser support for parsing strings is inconsistent. Because there is no specification on which formats should be supported, what works in some browsers will not work in other browsers.

For consistent results parsing anything other than ISO 8601 strings, you should use String + Format.

Supported ISO 8601 strings

An ISO 8601 string requires a date part.

2013-02-08  # A calendar date part
2013-W06-5  # A week date part
2013-039    # An ordinal date part
A time part can also be included, separated from the date part by a space or a uppercase T.

2013-02-08T09            # An hour time part separated by a T
2013-02-08 09            # An hour time part separated by a space
2013-02-08 09:30         # An hour and minute time part
2013-02-08 09:30:26      # An hour, minute, and second time part
2013-02-08 09:30:26.123  # An hour, minute, second, and millisecond time part
2013-02-08 24:00:00.000  # hour 24, minute, second, millisecond equal 0 means next day at midnight
Any of the date parts can have a time part.

2013-02-08 09  # A calendar date part and hour time part
2013-W06-5 09  # A week date part and hour time part
2013-039 09    # An ordinal date part and hour time part
If a time part is included, an offset from UTC can also be included as +-HH:mm, +-HHmm, or Z.

2013-02-08 09+07:00            # +-HH:mm
2013-02-08 09-0100             # +-HHmm
2013-02-08 09Z                 # Z
2013-02-08 09:30:26.123+07:00  # +-HH:mm
Note: Automatic cross browser ISO-8601 support was added in version 1.5.0. Support for the week and ordinal formats was added in version 2.3.0.

If a string does not match any of the above formats and is not able to be parsed with Date.parse, moment#isValid will return false.

moment("not a real date").isValid(); // false
String + Format 1.0.0+

edit
moment(String, String);
moment(String, String, String);
moment(String, String, Boolean);
moment(String, String, String, Boolean);
If you know the format of an input string, you can use that to parse a moment.

moment("12-25-1995", "MM-DD-YYYY");
The parser ignores non-alphanumeric characters, so both of the following will return the same thing.

moment("12-25-1995", "MM-DD-YYYY");
moment("12/25/1995", "MM-DD-YYYY");
The parsing tokens are similar to the formatting tokens used in moment#format.

Year, month, and day tokens

Input	Example	Description
YYYY	2014	4 or 2 digit year
YY	14	2 digit year
Q	1..4	Quarter of year. Sets month to first month in quarter.
M MM	1..12	Month number
MMM MMMM	Jan..December	Month name in locale set by moment.locale()
D DD	1..31	Day of month
Do	1st..31st	Day of month with ordinal
DDD DDDD	1..365	Day of year
X	1410715640.579	Unix timestamp
x	1410715640579	Unix ms timestamp
YYYY from version 2.10.5 supports 2 digit years, and converts them to a year near 2000 (same as YY).

Week year, week, and weekday tokens

For these, the lowercase tokens use the locale aware week start days, and the uppercase tokens use the ISO week date start days.

Input	Example	Description
gggg	2014	Locale 4 digit week year
gg	14	Locale 2 digit week year
w ww	1..53	Locale week of year
e	1..7	Locale day of week
ddd dddd	Mon...Sunday	Day name in locale set by moment.locale()
GGGG	2014	ISO 4 digit week year
GG	14	ISO 2 digit week year
W WW	1..53	ISO week of year
E	1..7	ISO day of week
Hour, minute, second, millisecond, and offset tokens

Input	Example	Description
H HH	0..23	24 hour time
h hh	1..12	12 hour time used with a A.
a A	am pm	Post or ante meridiem
m mm	0..59	Minutes
s ss	0..59	Seconds
S	0..9	Tenths of a second
SS	0..99	Hundreds of a second
SSS	0..999	Thousandths of a second
SSSS	0000..9999	fractional seconds
Z ZZ	+12:00	Offset from UTC as +-HH:mm, +-HHmm, or Z
From version 2.10.5: fractional second tokens length 4 up to 9 can parse any number of digits, but will only consider the top 3 (milliseconds). Use if you have the time printed with many fractional digits and want to consume the input.

Locale aware date and time formats are also available using LT LTS L LL LLL LLLL. They were added in version 2.2.1, except LTS which was added 2.8.4.

Z ZZ were added in version 1.2.0.

S SS SSS were added in version 1.6.0.

X was added in version 2.0.0.

Unless you specify a timezone offset, parsing a string will create a date in the current timezone.

moment("2010-10-20 4:30",       "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm");   // parsed as 4:30 local time
moment("2010-10-20 4:30 +0000", "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm Z"); // parsed as 4:30 UTC
If the moment that results from the parsed input does not exist, moment#isValid will return false.

moment("2010 13",           "YYYY MM").isValid();     // false (not a real month)
moment("2010 11 31",        "YYYY MM DD").isValid();  // false (not a real day)
moment("2010 2 29",         "YYYY MM DD").isValid();  // false (not a leap year)
moment("2010 notamonth 29", "YYYY MMM DD").isValid(); // false (not a real month name)
As of version 2.0.0, a locale key can be passed as the third parameter to moment() and moment.utc().

moment('2012 juillet', 'YYYY MMM', 'fr');
moment('2012 July',    'YYYY MMM', 'en');
Moment's parser is very forgiving, and this can lead to undesired behavior. As of version 2.3.0, you may specify a boolean for the last argument to make Moment use strict parsing. Strict parsing requires that the format and input match exactly.

moment('It is 2012-05-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD').isValid();       // true
moment('It is 2012-05-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD', true).isValid(); // false
moment('2012-05-25',       'YYYY-MM-DD', true).isValid(); // true
You can use both locale and strictness.

moment('2012-10-14', 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'fr', true);
Parsing two digit years

By default, two digit years above 68 are assumed to be in the 1900's and years 68 or below are assumed to be in the 2000's. This can be changed by replacing the moment.parseTwoDigitYear method.

String + Formats 1.0.0+

edit
moment(String, String[], String, Boolean);
If you don't know the exact format of an input string, but know it could be one of many, you can use an array of formats.

This is the same as String + Format, only it will try to match the input to multiple formats.

moment("12-25-1995", ["MM-DD-YYYY", "YYYY-MM-DD"]);
Starting in version 2.3.0, Moment uses some simple heuristics to determine which format to use. In order:

Prefer formats resulting in valid dates over invalid ones.
Prefer formats that parse more of the string than less and use more of the format than less, i.e. prefer stricter parsing.
Prefer formats earlier in the array than later.
moment("29-06-1995", ["MM-DD-YYYY", "DD-MM", "DD-MM-YYYY"]); // uses the last format
moment("05-06-1995", ["MM-DD-YYYY", "DD-MM-YYYY"]);          // uses the first format
You may also specify a locale and strictness argument. They work the same was as they do in the single format case.

moment("29-06-1995", ["MM-DD-YYYY", "DD-MM-YYYY"], 'fr');       // uses 'fr' locale
moment("29-06-1995", ["MM-DD-YYYY", "DD-MM-YYYY"], true);       // uses strict parsing
moment("05-06-1995", ["MM-DD-YYYY", "DD-MM-YYYY"], 'fr', true); // uses 'fr' locale and strict parsing
Note: Parsing multiple formats is considerably slower than parsing a single format. If you can avoid it, it is much faster to parse a single format.

Special Formats 2.7.0+

edit
moment(String, moment.CUSTOM_FORMAT, [String], [Boolean]);
moment(String, [..., moment.ISO_8601, ...], [String], [Boolean]);
ISO-8601 is a standard for time and duration display. Moment already supports parsing iso-8601 strings, but this can be specified explicitly in the format/list of formats when constructing a moment.

To specify iso-8601 parsing use moment.ISO_8601 constant. More formats will be added in the future.

Examples:

moment("2010-01-01T05:06:07", moment.ISO_8601);
moment("2010-01-01T05:06:07", ["YYYY", moment.ISO_8601]);
Object 2.2.1+

edit
moment({unit: value, ...});
moment({ hour:15, minute:10 });
moment({ y    :2010, M     :3, d   :5, h    :15, m      :10, s      :3, ms          :123});
moment({ year :2010, month :3, day :5, hour :15, minute :10, second :3, millisecond :123});
moment({ years:2010, months:3, days:5, hours:15, minutes:10, seconds:3, milliseconds:123});
moment({ years:2010, months:3, date:5, hours:15, minutes:10, seconds:3, milliseconds:123});
You can create a moment by specifying some of the units in an object.

Omitted units default to 0 or the current date, month, and year.

day and date key both mean day-of-the-month.

date was added in 2.8.4.

Note that like moment(Array) and new Date(year, month, date), months are 0 indexed.

Unix Offset (milliseconds) 1.0.0+

edit
moment(Number);
Similar to new Date(Number), you can create a moment by passing an integer value representing the number of milliseconds since the Unix Epoch (Jan 1 1970 12AM UTC).

var day = moment(1318781876406);
Unix Timestamp (seconds) 1.6.0+

edit
moment.unix(Number)
To create a moment from a Unix timestamp (seconds since the Unix Epoch), use moment.unix(Number).

var day = moment.unix(1318781876);
This is implemented as moment(timestamp * 1000), so partial seconds in the input timestamp are included.

var day = moment.unix(1318781876.721);
Date 1.0.0+

edit
moment(Date);
You can create a Moment with a pre-existing native Javascript Date object.

var day = new Date(2011, 9, 16);
var dayWrapper = moment(day);
This clones Date object; further changes to the Date won't affect the Moment, and vice-versa.

Array 1.0.0+

edit
moment(Number[]);
You can create a moment with an array of numbers that mirror the parameters passed to new Date()

[year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond]
moment([2010, 1, 14, 15, 25, 50, 125]); // February 14th, 3:25:50.125 PM
Any value past the year is optional, and will default to the lowest possible number.

moment([2010]);        // January 1st
moment([2010, 6]);     // July 1st
moment([2010, 6, 10]); // July 10th
Construction with an array will create a date in the current timezone. To create a date from an array at UTC, use moment.utc(Number[]).

moment.utc([2010, 1, 14, 15, 25, 50, 125]);
Note: Because this mirrors the native Date parameters, months, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds are all zero indexed. Years and days of the month are 1 indexed.

This is often the cause of frustration, especially with months, so take note!

If the date represented by the array does not exist, moment#isValid will return false.

moment([2010, 13]).isValid();     // false (not a real month)
moment([2010, 10, 31]).isValid(); // false (not a real day)
moment([2010, 1, 29]).isValid();  // false (not a leap year)
ASP.NET JSON Date 1.3.0+

edit
moment(String);
Microsoft Web API returns JSON dates in proper ISO-8601 format by default, but older ASP.NET technologies may return dates in JSON as /Date(1198908717056)/ or /Date(1198908717056-0700)/

If a string that matches this format is passed in, it will be parsed correctly.

moment("/Date(1198908717056-0700)/"); // 2007-12-28T23:11:57.056-07:00
Moment Clone 1.2.0+

edit
moment(Moment);
All moments are mutable. If you want a clone of a moment, you can do so explicitly or implicitly.

Calling moment() on a moment will clone it.

var a = moment([2012]);
var b = moment(a);
a.year(2000);
b.year(); // 2012
Additionally, you can call moment#clone to clone a moment.

var a = moment([2012]);
var b = a.clone();
a.year(2000);
b.year(); // 2012
UTC 1.5.0+

edit
moment.utc();
moment.utc(Number);
moment.utc(Number[]);
moment.utc(String);
moment.utc(String, String);
moment.utc(String, String[]);
moment.utc(String, String, String);
moment.utc(Moment);
moment.utc(Date);
By default, moment parses and displays in local time.

If you want to parse or display a moment in UTC, you can use moment.utc() instead of moment().

This brings us to an interesting feature of Moment.js. UTC mode.

While in UTC mode, all display methods will display in UTC time instead of local time.

moment().format();     // 2013-02-04T10:35:24-08:00
moment.utc().format(); // 2013-02-04T18:35:24+00:00
Additionally, while in UTC mode, all getters and setters will internally use the Date#getUTC* and Date#setUTC* methods instead of the Date#get* and Date#set* methods.

moment.utc().seconds(30) === new Date().setUTCSeconds(30);
moment.utc().seconds()   === new Date().getUTCSeconds();
It is important to note that though the displays differ above, they are both the same moment in time.

var a = moment();
var b = moment.utc();
a.format();  // 2013-02-04T10:35:24-08:00
b.format();  // 2013-02-04T18:35:24+00:00
a.valueOf(); // 1360002924000
b.valueOf(); // 1360002924000
Any moment created with moment.utc() will be in UTC mode, and any moment created with moment() will not.

To switch from UTC to local time, you can use moment#utc or moment#local.

var a = moment.utc([2011, 0, 1, 8]);
a.hours(); // 8 UTC
a.local();
a.hours(); // 0 PST
parseZone 2.3.0+

edit
moment.parseZone(String)
Moment normally interprets input times as local times (or UTC times if moment.utc() is used). However, often the input string itself contains time zone information. #parseZone parses the time and then sets the zone according to the input string.

moment.parseZone("2013-01-01T00:00:00-13:00").zone(); // 780
moment.parseZone is equivalent to parsing the string and using moment#zone to parse the zone.

var s = "2013-01-01T00:00:00-13:00";
moment(s).zone(s);
Note: this method only works for a single string argument, not a string and format.

Validation 1.7.0+

edit
moment().isValid();
Moment applies stricter initialization rules than the Date constructor.

new Date(2013, 25, 14).toString(); // "Sat Feb 14 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (EST)"
moment([2015, 25, 35]).format();   // 'Invalid date'
You can check whether the Moment considers the date invalid using moment#isValid. You can check the metrics used by #isValid using moment#parsingFlags, which returns an object.

The following parsing flags result in an invalid date:

overflow: An overflow of a date field, such as a 13th month, a 32nd day of the month (or a 29th of February on non-leap years), a 367th day of the year, etc. overflow contains the index of the invalid unit to match #invalidAt (see below); -1 means no overflow.
invalidMonth: An invalid month name, such as moment('Marbruary', 'MMMM');. Contains the invalid month string itself, or else null.
empty: An input string that contains nothing parsable, such as moment('this is nonsense');. Boolean.
nullInput: A null input, like moment(null);. Boolean.
invalidFormat: An empty list of formats, such as moment('2013-05-25', []). Boolean.
userInvalidated: A date created explicitly as invalid, such as moment.invalid(). Boolean.
Additionally, if the Moment is parsed in strict mode, these flags must be empty for the Moment to be valid:

unusedTokens: array of format substrings not found in the input string
unusedInput: array of input substrings not matched to the format string
Note: Moment's concept of validity became more strict and consistent between 2.2 and 2.3.

Additionally, you can use moment#invalidAt to determine which date unit overflowed.

var m = moment("2011-10-10T10:20:90");
m.isValid(); // false
m.invalidAt(); // 5 for seconds
The return value has the following meaning:

years
months
days
hours
minutes
seconds
milliseconds
Note: In case of multiple wrong units the first one is returned (because days validity may depend on month, for example).

Defaults 2.2.1+

edit
moment("15", "hh")
You can create a moment object specifying only some of the units, and the rest will be defaulted to the current day, month or year, or 0 for hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.

Defaulting to now, when nothing is passed:

moment();  // current date and time
Defaulting to today, when only hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds are passed:

moment(5, "HH");  // today, 5:00:00.000
moment({hour: 5});  // today, 5:00:00.000
moment({hour: 5, minute: 10});  // today, 5:10.00.000
moment({hour: 5, minute: 10, seconds: 20});  // today, 5:10.20.000
moment({hour: 5, minute: 10, seconds: 20, milliseconds: 300});  // today, 5:10.20.300
Defaulting to this month and year, when only days and smaller units are passed:

moment(5, "DD");  // this month, 5th day-of-month
moment("4 05:06:07", "DD hh:mm:ss");  // this month, 4th day-of-month, 05:06:07.000
Defaulting to this year, if year is not specified:

moment(3, "MM");  // this year, 3th month (April)
moment("Apr 4 05:06:07", "MMM DD hh:mm:ss");  // this year, 5th April, 05:06:07.000
Get + Set
Moment.js uses overloaded getters and setters. You may be familiar with this pattern from its use in jQuery.

Calling these methods without parameters acts as a getter, and calling them with a parameter acts as a setter.

These map to the corresponding function on the native Date object.

moment().seconds(30) === new Date().setSeconds(30);
moment().seconds()   === new Date().getSeconds();
If you are in UTC mode, they will map to the UTC equivalent.

moment.utc().seconds(30) === new Date().setUTCSeconds(30);
moment.utc().seconds()   === new Date().getUTCSeconds();
For convenience, both singular and plural method names exist as of version 2.0.0.

Note: All of these methods mutate the original moment when used as setters.

Millisecond 1.3.0+

edit
moment().millisecond(Number);
moment().millisecond(); // Number
moment().milliseconds(Number);
moment().milliseconds(); // Number
Gets or sets the milliseconds.

Accepts numbers from 0 to 999. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the seconds.

Second 1.0.0+

edit
moment().second(Number);
moment().second(); // Number
moment().seconds(Number);
moment().seconds(); // Number
Gets or sets the seconds.

Accepts numbers from 0 to 59. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the minutes.

Minute 1.0.0+

edit
moment().minute(Number);
moment().minute(); // Number
moment().minutes(Number);
moment().minutes(); // Number
Gets or sets the minutes.

Accepts numbers from 0 to 59. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the hours.

Hour 1.0.0+

edit
moment().hour(Number);
moment().hour(); // Number
moment().hours(Number);
moment().hours(); // Number
Gets or sets the hour.

Accepts numbers from 0 to 23. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the day.

Date of Month 1.0.0+

edit
moment().date(Number);
moment().date(); // Number
moment().dates(Number);
moment().dates(); // Number
Gets or sets the day of the month.

Accepts numbers from 1 to 31. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the months.

Note: Moment#date is for the date of the month, and Moment#day is for the day of the week.

Day of Week 1.3.0+

edit
moment().day(Number|String);
moment().day(); // Number
moment().days(Number|String);
moment().days(); // Number
Gets or sets the day of the week.

This method can be used to set the day of the week, with Sunday as 0 and Saturday as 6.

If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to other weeks.

moment().day(-7); // last Sunday (0 - 7)
moment().day(7); // next Sunday (0 + 7)
moment().day(10); // next Wednesday (3 + 7)
moment().day(24); // 3 Wednesdays from now (3 + 7 + 7 + 7)
Note: Moment#date is for the date of the month, and Moment#day is for the day of the week.

As of 2.1.0, a day name is also supported. This is parsed in the moment's current locale.

moment().day("Sunday");
moment().day("Monday");
Day of Week (Locale Aware) 2.1.0+

edit
moment().weekday(Number);
moment().weekday(); // Number
Gets or sets the day of the week according to the locale.

If the locale assigns Monday as the first day of the week, moment().weekday(0) will be Monday. If Sunday is the first day of the week, moment().weekday(0) will be Sunday.

As with moment#day, if the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to other weeks.

// when Monday is the first day of the week
moment().weekday(-7); // last Monday
moment().weekday(7); // next Monday
// when Sunday is the first day of the week
moment().weekday(-7); // last Sunday
moment().weekday(7); // next Sunday
ISO Day of Week 2.1.0+

edit
moment().isoWeekday(Number);
moment().isoWeekday(); // Number
Gets or sets the ISO day of the week with 1 being Monday and 7 being Sunday.

moment().isoWeekday(1); // Monday
moment().isoWeekday(7); // Sunday
Day of Year 2.0.0+

edit
moment().dayOfYear(Number);
moment().dayOfYear(); // Number
Gets or sets the day of the year.

Accepts numbers from 1 to 366. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the years.

Week of Year 2.0.0+

edit
moment().week(Number);
moment().week(); // Number
moment().weeks(Number);
moment().weeks(); // Number
Gets or sets the week of the year.

Because different locales define week of year numbering differently, Moment.js added moment#week to get/set the localized week of the year.

The week of the year varies depending on which day is the first day of the week (Sunday, Monday, etc), and which week is the first week of the year.

For example, in the United States, Sunday is the first day of the week. The week with January 1st in it is the first week of the year.

In France, Monday is the first day of the week, and the week with January 4th is the first week of the year.

The output of moment#week will depend on the locale for that moment.

When setting the week of the year, the day of the week is retained.

Week of Year (ISO) 2.0.0+

edit
moment().isoWeek(Number);
moment().isoWeek(); // Number
moment().isoWeeks(Number);
moment().isoWeeks(); // Number
Gets or sets the ISO week of the year.

When setting the week of the year, the day of the week is retained.

Month 1.0.0+

edit
moment().month(Number|String);
moment().month(); // Number
moment().months(Number|String);
moment().months(); // Number
Gets or sets the month.

Accepts numbers from 0 to 11. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the year.

Note: Months are zero indexed, so January is month 0.

As of 2.1.0, a month name is also supported. This is parsed in the moment's current locale.

moment().month("January");
moment().month("Feb");
Before version 2.1.0, if a moment changed months and the new month did not have enough days to keep the current day of month, it would overflow to the next month.

As of version 2.1.0, this was changed to be clamped to the end of the target month.

// before 2.1.0
moment([2012, 0, 31]).month(1).format("YYYY-MM-DD"); // 2012-03-02
// after 2.1.0
moment([2012, 0, 31]).month(1).format("YYYY-MM-DD"); // 2012-02-29
Quarter 2.6.0+

edit
moment().quarter(); // Number
moment().quarter(Number);
Gets the quarter (1 to 4).

moment('2013-01-01T00:00:00.000').quarter() // 1
moment('2013-04-01T00:00:00.000').subtract(1, 'ms').quarter() // 1
moment('2013-04-01T00:00:00.000').quarter() // 2
moment('2013-07-01T00:00:00.000').subtract(1, 'ms').quarter() // 2
moment('2013-07-01T00:00:00.000').quarter() // 3
moment('2013-10-01T00:00:00.000').subtract(1, 'ms').quarter() // 3
moment('2013-10-01T00:00:00.000').quarter() // 4
moment('2014-01-01T00:00:00.000').subtract(1, 'ms').quarter() // 4
Sets the quarter (1 to 4).

moment('2013-01-01T00:00:00.000').quarter(2) // '2013-04-01T00:00:00.000'
moment('2013-02-05T05:06:07.000').quarter(2).format() // '2013-05-05T05:06:07-07:00'
Year 1.0.0+

edit
moment().year(Number);
moment().year(); // Number
moment().years(Number);
moment().years(); // Number
Gets or sets the year.

Accepts numbers from -270,000 to 270,000.

Week Year 2.1.0+

edit
moment().weekYear(Number);
moment().weekYear(); // Number
Gets or sets the week-year according to the locale.

Because the first day of the first week does not always fall on the first day of the year, sometimes the week-year will differ from the month year.

For example, in the US, the week that contains Jan 1 is always the first week. In the US, weeks also start on Sunday. If Jan 1 was a Monday, Dec 31 would belong to the same week as Jan 1, and thus the same week-year as Jan 1. Dec 30 would have a different week-year than Dec 31.

Week Year (ISO) 2.1.0+

edit
moment().isoWeekYear(Number);
moment().isoWeekYear(); // Number
Gets or sets the ISO week-year.

Weeks In Year 2.6.0+

edit
moment().weeksInYear();
Gets the number of weeks according to locale in the current moment's year.

Weeks In Year (ISO) 2.6.0+

edit
moment().isoWeeksInYear();
Gets the number of weeks in the current moment's year, according to ISO weeks.

Get 2.2.1+

edit
moment().get('year');
moment().get('month');  // 0 to 11
moment().get('date');
moment().get('hour');
moment().get('minute');
moment().get('second');
moment().get('millisecond');
String getter. In general

moment().get(unit) === moment()[unit]()
Units are case insensitive, and support plural and short forms: year (years, y), month (months, M), date (dates, D), hour (hours, h), minute (minutes, m), second (seconds, s), millisecond (milliseconds, ms).

Set 2.2.1+

edit
moment().set(String, Int);
moment().set(Object(String, Int));
Generic setter, accepting unit as first argument, and value as second:

moment().set('year', 2013);
moment().set('month', 3);  // April
moment().set('date', 1);
moment().set('hour', 13);
moment().set('minute', 20);
moment().set('second', 30);
moment().set('millisecond', 123);

moment().set({'year': 2013, 'month': 3});
Units are case insensitive, and support plural and short forms: year (years, y), month (months, M), date (dates, D), hour (hours, h), minute (minutes, m), second (seconds, s), millisecond (milliseconds, ms).

Object parsing was added in 2.9.0

Maximum 2.7.0+

edit
moment.max(Moment[,Moment...]);
Returns the maximum (most distant future) of the given moment instances.

For example:

var a = moment().subtract(1, 'day');
var b = moment().add(1, 'day');
moment.max(a, b);  // b
With no arguments the function returns a moment instance with the current time.

From version 2.10.5, if an invalid moment is one of the arguments, the result is an invalid moment.

moment.max(moment(), moment.invalid()).isValid() === false
moment.max(moment.invalid(), moment()).isValid() === false
Minimum 2.7.0+

edit
moment.min(Moment[,Moment...]);
Returns the minimum (most distant past) of the given moment instances.

For example:

var a = moment().subtract(1, 'day');
var b = moment().add(1, 'day');
moment.min(a, b);  // a
With no arguments the function returns a moment instance with the current time.

From version 2.10.5, if an invalid moment is one of the arguments, the result is an invalid moment.

moment.min(moment(), moment.invalid()).isValid() === false
moment.min(moment.invalid(), moment()).isValid() === false
Manipulate
Once you have a Moment, you may want to manipulate it in some way. There are a number of methods to help with this.

Moment.js uses the fluent interface pattern, also known as method chaining. This allows you to do crazy things like the following.

moment().add(7, 'days').subtract(1, 'months').year(2009).hours(0).minutes(0).seconds(0);
Note: It should be noted that moments are mutable. Calling any of the manipulation methods will change the original moment.

If you want to create a copy and manipulate it, you should use moment#clone before manipulating the moment. More info on cloning.

Add 1.0.0+

edit
moment().add(Number, String);
moment().add(Duration);
moment().add(Object);
Mutates the original moment by adding time.

This is a pretty robust function for adding time to an existing moment. To add time, pass the key of what time you want to add, and the amount you want to add.

moment().add(7, 'days');
There are some shorthand keys as well if you're into that whole brevity thing.

moment().add(7, 'd');
Key	Shorthand
years	y
quarters	Q
months	M
weeks	w
days	d
hours	h
minutes	m
seconds	s
milliseconds	ms
If you want to add multiple different keys at the same time, you can pass them in as an object literal.

moment().add(7, 'days').add(1, 'months'); // with chaining
moment().add({days:7,months:1}); // with object literal
There are no upper limits for the amounts, so you can overload any of the parameters.

moment().add(1000000, 'milliseconds'); // a million milliseconds
moment().add(360, 'days'); // 360 days
Special considerations for months and years

If the day of the month on the original date is greater than the number of days in the final month, the day of the month will change to the last day in the final month.

moment([2010, 0, 31]);                  // January 31
moment([2010, 0, 31]).add(1, 'months'); // February 28
There are also special considerations to keep in mind when adding time that crosses over daylight saving time. If you are adding years, months, weeks, or days, the original hour will always match the added hour.

var m = moment(new Date(2011, 2, 12, 5, 0, 0)); // the day before DST in the US
m.hours(); // 5
m.add(1, 'days').hours(); // 5
If you are adding hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds, the assumption is that you want precision to the hour, and will result in a different hour.

var m = moment(new Date(2011, 2, 12, 5, 0, 0)); // the day before DST in the US
m.hours(); // 5
m.add(24, 'hours').hours(); // 6
Alternatively, you can use durations to add to moments.

var duration = moment.duration({'days' : 1});
moment([2012, 0, 31]).add(duration); // February 1
Before version 2.8.0, the moment#add(String, Number) syntax was also supported. It has been deprecated in favor of moment#add(Number, String).

moment().add('seconds', 1); // Deprecated in 2.8.0
moment().add(1, 'seconds');
Subtract 1.0.0+

edit
moment().subtract(Number, String);
moment().subtract(Duration);
moment().subtract(Object);
Mutates the original moment by subtracting time.

This is exactly the same as moment#add, only instead of adding time, it subtracts time.

moment().subtract(7, 'days');
Before version 2.8.0, the moment#subtract(String, Number) syntax was also supported. It has been deprecated in favor of moment#subtract(Number, String).

moment().subtract('seconds', 1); // Deprecated in 2.8.0
moment().subtract(1, 'seconds');
Start of Time 1.7.0+

edit
moment().startOf(String);
Mutates the original moment by setting it to the start of a unit of time.

moment().startOf('year');    // set to January 1st, 12:00 am this year
moment().startOf('month');   // set to the first of this month, 12:00 am
moment().startOf('quarter');  // set to the beginning of the current quarter, 1st day of months, 12:00 am
moment().startOf('week');    // set to the first day of this week, 12:00 am
moment().startOf('isoWeek'); // set to the first day of this week according to ISO 8601, 12:00 am
moment().startOf('day');     // set to 12:00 am today
moment().startOf('hour');    // set to now, but with 0 mins, 0 secs, and 0 ms
moment().startOf('minute');  // set to now, but with 0 seconds and 0 milliseconds
moment().startOf('second');  // same as moment().milliseconds(0);
These shortcuts are essentially the same as the following.

moment().startOf('year');
moment().month(0).date(1).hours(0).minutes(0).seconds(0).milliseconds(0);
moment().startOf('hour');
moment().minutes(0).seconds(0).milliseconds(0)
As of version 2.0.0, moment#startOf('day') replaced moment#sod.

Note: moment#startOf('week') was added in version 2.0.0.

As of version 2.1.0, moment#startOf('week') uses the locale aware week start day.

Note: moment#startOf('isoWeek') was added in version 2.2.0.

End of Time 1.7.0+

edit
moment().endOf(String);
Mutates the original moment by setting it to the end of a unit of time.

This is the same as moment#startOf, only instead of setting to the start of a unit of time, it sets to the end of a unit of time.

moment().endOf("year"); // set the moment to 12-31 11:59:59.999 pm this year
As of version 2.0.0, moment#endOf('day') replaced moment#eod.

Note: moment#endOf('week') was added in version 2.0.0.

As of version 2.1.0, moment#endOf('week') uses the locale aware week start day.

Maximum From 2.1.0, Deprecated 2.7.0

edit
moment().max(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
NOTE: This function has been deprecated in 2.7.0. Consider moment.min instead.

Limits the moment to a maximum of another moment value. So a.max(b) is the same as a = moment.min(a, b) (note that max is converted to min).

Sometimes, server clocks are not quite in sync with client clocks. This ends up displaying humanized strings such as "in a few seconds" rather than "a few seconds ago". You can prevent that with moment#max():

This is the counterpart for moment#min.

var momentFromServer = moment(input);
var clampedMoment = momentFromServer.max();
You can pass anything to moment#max that you would pass to moment().

moment().max(moment().add(1, 'd'));
moment().max("2013-04-20T20:00:00+0800");
moment().max("Jan 1 2001", "MMM D YYYY");
moment().max(new Date(2012, 1, 8));
Minimum From 2.1.0, Deprecated 2.7.0

edit
moment().min(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
NOTE: This function has been deprecated in 2.7.0. Consider moment.max instead.

Limits the moment to a minimum of another moment value. So a.min(b) is the same as a = moment.max(a, b) (note that min is converted to max).

This is the counterpart for moment#max.

moment().min("2013-04-20T20:00:00+0800");
This can be used in conjunction with moment#max to clamp a moment to a range.

var start  = moment().startOf('week');
var end    = moment().endOf('week');
var actual = moment().min(start).max(end);
Local 1.5.0+

edit
moment().local();
Sets a flag on the original moment to internally use Date#get* and Date#set* instead of Date#getUTC* and Date#setUTC*.

var a = moment.utc([2011, 0, 1, 8]);
a.hours(); // 8 UTC
a.local();
a.hours(); // 0 PST
See moment.utc() for more information on UTC mode.

UTC 1.5.0+

edit
moment().utc();
Sets a flag on the original moment to internally use Date#getUTC* and Date#setUTC* instead of Date#get* and Date#set*.

var a = moment([2011, 0, 1, 8]);
a.hours(); // 8 PST
a.utc();
a.hours(); // 16 UTC
See moment.utc() for more information on UTC mode.

UTC Offset 2.9.0++

edit
moment().utcOffset();
moment().utcOffset(Number|String);
Get the utc offset in minutes.

NOTE: Unlike moment.fn.zone this function returns the real offset from UTC, not the reverse offset (as returned by Date.prototype.getTimezoneOffset).

Getting the utcOffset of the current object:

moment().utcOffset(); // (-240, -120, -60, 0, 60, 120, 240, etc.)
Setting the utc offset by supplying minutes. Note that once you set an offset, it's fixed and won't change on its own (i.e there are no DST rules). If you want an actual timezone -- time in a particular location, like America/Los_Angeles, consider moment-timezone.

moment().utcOffset(120);
If the input is less than 16 and greater than -16, it will interpret your input as hours instead.

// these are equivalent
moment().utcOffset(8);  // set hours offset
moment().utcOffset(480);  // set minutes offset (8 * 60)
It is also possible to set the utc offset from a string.

// these are equivalent
moment().utcOffset("+08:00");
moment().utcOffset(8);
moment().utcOffset(480);
moment#utcOffset will search the string for the first match of +00:00 +0000 -00:00 -0000, so you can even pass an ISO8601 formatted string and the moment will be changed to that utc offset.

Note that the string is required to start with the + or - character. Passing a string that does not start with + or - will be interpreted as if it were "+00:00".

moment().utcOffset("2013-03-07T07:00:00+08:00");
Timezone Offset From 1.2.0, deprecated 2.9.0+

edit
moment().zone();
moment().zone(Number|String);
NOTE: This function has been deprecated in 2.9.0. Consider moment.fn.utcOffset instead.

Get the timezone offset in minutes.

moment().zone(); // (60, 120, 240, etc.)
As of version 2.1.0, it is possible to set the offset by passing in the number of minutes offset from GMT.

moment().zone(120);
If the input is less than 16 and greater than -16, it will interpret your input as hours instead.

// these are equivalent
moment().zone(480);
moment().zone(8);
It is also possible to set the zone from a string.

moment().zone("-08:00");
moment#zone will search the string for the first match of +00:00 +0000 -00:00 -0000, so you can even pass an ISO8601 formatted string and the moment will be changed to that zone.

moment().zone("2013-03-07T07:00:00-08:00");
Display
Once parsing and manipulation are done, you need some way to display the moment.

Format 1.0.0+

edit
moment().format();
moment().format(String);
This is the most robust display option. It takes a string of tokens and replaces them with their corresponding values.

moment().format();                                // "2014-09-08T08:02:17-05:00" (ISO 8601)
moment().format("dddd, MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a"); // "Sunday, February 14th 2010, 3:25:50 pm"
moment().format("ddd, hA");                       // "Sun, 3PM"
moment('gibberish').format('YYYY MM DD');         // "Invalid date"

Localized formats

Because preferred formatting differs based on locale, there are a few tokens that can be used to format a moment based on its locale.

There are upper and lower case variations on the same formats. The lowercase version is intended to be the shortened version of its uppercase counterpart.

Time	LT	8:30 PM
Time with seconds	LTS	8:30:25 PM
Month numeral, day of month, year	L	09/04/1986
l	9/4/1986
Month name, day of month, year	LL	September 4 1986
ll	Sep 4 1986
Month name, day of month, year, time	LLL	September 4 1986 8:30 PM
lll	Sep 4 1986 8:30 PM
Month name, day of month, day of week, year, time	LLLL	Thursday, September 4 1986 8:30 PM
llll	Thu, Sep 4 1986 8:30 PM
L LL LLL LLLL LT are available in version 1.3.0. l ll lll llll are available in 2.0.0. LTS was added in 2.8.4.

Escaping characters

To escape characters in format strings, you can wrap the characters in square brackets.

moment().format('[today] dddd'); // 'today Sunday'
Similarities and differences with LDML

Note: While these date formats are very similar to LDML date formats, there are a few minor differences regarding day of month, day of year, and day of week.

For a breakdown of a few different date formatting tokens across different locales, see this chart of date formatting tokens.

Formatting speed

To compare Moment.js formatting speed against other libraries, check out this comparison against other libraries.

Other tokens

If you are more comfortable working with strftime instead of LDML-like parsing tokens, you can use Ben Oakes' plugin. benjaminoakes/moment-strftime.

Default format

As of version 1.5.0, calling moment#format without a format will default to moment.defaultFormat. Out of the box, moment.defaultFormat is the ISO8601 format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ.

Time from now 1.0.0+

edit
moment().fromNow();
moment().fromNow(Boolean);
A common way of displaying time is handled by moment#fromNow. This is sometimes called timeago or relative time.

moment([2007, 0, 29]).fromNow(); // 4 years ago
If you pass true, you can get the value without the suffix.

moment([2007, 0, 29]).fromNow();     // 4 years ago
moment([2007, 0, 29]).fromNow(true); // 4 years
The base strings are customized by the current locale.

The breakdown of which string is displayed for each length of time is outlined in the table below.

Range	Key	Sample Output
0 to 45 seconds	s	a few seconds ago
45 to 90 seconds	m	a minute ago
90 seconds to 45 minutes	mm	2 minutes ago ... 45 minutes ago
45 to 90 minutes	h	an hour ago
90 minutes to 22 hours 	hh	2 hours ago ... 22 hours ago
22 to 36 hours	d	a day ago
36 hours to 25 days	dd	2 days ago ... 25 days ago
25 to 45 days	M	a month ago
45 to 345 days	MM	2 months ago ... 11 months ago
345 to 545 days (1.5 years)	y	a year ago
546 days+	yy	2 years ago ... 20 years ago
From version 2.10.3, if the target moment object is invalid the result is the localized Invalid date string.

Time from X 1.0.0+

edit
moment().from(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().from(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, Boolean);
You may want to display a moment in relation to a time other than now. In that case, you can use moment#from.

var a = moment([2007, 0, 28]);
var b = moment([2007, 0, 29]);
a.from(b) // "a day ago"
The first parameter is anything you can pass to moment() or an actual Moment.

var a = moment([2007, 0, 28]);
var b = moment([2007, 0, 29]);
a.from(b);                     // "a day ago"
a.from([2007, 0, 29]);         // "a day ago"
a.from(new Date(2007, 0, 29)); // "a day ago"
a.from("2007-01-29");          // "a day ago"
Like moment#fromNow, passing true as the second parameter returns value without the suffix. This is useful wherever you need to have a human readable length of time.

var start = moment([2007, 0, 5]);
var end   = moment([2007, 0, 10]);
end.from(start);       // "in 5 days"
end.from(start, true); // "5 days"
From version 2.10.3, if any of the endpoints are invalid the result is the localized Invalid date string.

Time to now 2.10.3+

edit
moment().toNow();
moment().toNow(Boolean);
A common way of displaying time is handled by moment#toNow. This is sometimes called timeago or relative time.

This is similar to moment.fromNow, but gives the opposite interval: a.fromNow() = - a.toNow().

This is similar to moment.to, but is special-cased for the current time. Use moment.to, if you want to control the two end points of the interval.

moment([2007, 0, 29]).toNow(); // in 4 years
If you pass true, you can get the value without the prefix.

moment([2007, 0, 29]).toNow();     // in 4 years
moment([2007, 0, 29]).toNow(true); // 4 years
The base strings are customized by the current locale.

The breakdown of which string is displayed for each length of time is outlined in the table below.

Range	Key	Sample Output
0 to 45 seconds	s	in seconds
45 to 90 seconds	m	in a minute
90 seconds to 45 minutes	mm	in 2 minutes ... in 45 minutes
45 to 90 minutes	h	in an hour
90 minutes to 22 hours 	hh	in 2 hours ... in 22 hours
22 to 36 hours	d	in a day
36 hours to 25 days	dd	in 2 days ... in 25 days
25 to 45 days	M	in a month
45 to 345 days	MM	in 2 months ... in 11 months
345 to 547 days (1.5 years)	y	in a year
548 days+	yy	in 2 years ... in 20 years
From version 2.10.3, if the target moment object is invalid the result is the localized Invalid date string.

Time to X 2.10.3+

edit
moment().to(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().to(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, Boolean);
You may want to display a moment in relation to a time other than now. In that case, you can use moment#to.

var a = moment([2007, 0, 28]);
var b = moment([2007, 0, 29]);
a.to(b) // "in a day"
The first parameter is anything you can pass to moment() or an actual Moment.

var a = moment([2007, 0, 28]);
var b = moment([2007, 0, 29]);
a.to(b);                     // "in a day"
a.to([2007, 0, 29]);         // "in a day"
a.to(new Date(2007, 0, 29)); // "in a day"
a.to("2007-01-29");          // "in a day"
Like moment#toNow, passing true as the second parameter returns value without the suffix. This is useful wherever you need to have a human readable length of time.

var start = moment([2007, 0, 5]);
var end   = moment([2007, 0, 10]);
end.to(start);       // "5 days ago"
end.to(start, true); // "5 days"
From version 2.10.3, if any of the endpoints are invalid the result is the localized Invalid date string.

Calendar Time 1.3.0+

edit
moment().calendar();
moment().calendar(referenceTime);
moment().calendar(referenceTime, formats);  // from 2.10.5
Calendar time displays time relative to a given referenceTime (defaults to now), but does so slightly differently than moment#fromNow.

moment#calendar will format a date with different strings depending on how close to referenceTime's date (today by default) the date is.

Last week	Last Monday at 2:30 AM
The day before	Yesterday at 2:30 AM
The same day	Today at 2:30 AM
The next day	Tomorrow at 2:30 AM
The next week	Sunday at 2:30 AM
Everything else	7/10/2011
These strings are localized, and can be customized.

From 2.10.5 moment supports specifying calendar output formats per invocation:

moment().calendar(null, {
    sameDay: '[Today]',
    nextDay: '[Tomorrow]',
    nextWeek: 'dddd',
    lastDay: '[Yesterday]',
    lastWeek: '[Last] dddd'
});
Difference 1.0.0+

edit
moment().diff(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().diff(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, String);
moment().diff(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, String, Boolean);
To get the difference in milliseconds, use moment#diff like you would use moment#from.

var a = moment([2007, 0, 29]);
var b = moment([2007, 0, 28]);
a.diff(b) // 86400000
To get the difference in another unit of measurement, pass that measurement as the second argument.

var a = moment([2007, 0, 29]);
var b = moment([2007, 0, 28]);
a.diff(b, 'days') // 1
The supported measurements are years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. For ease of development, the singular forms are supported as of 2.0.0. Units of measurement other than milliseconds are available in version 1.1.1.

By default, moment#diff will return number rounded down. If you want the floating point number, pass true as the third argument. Before 2.0.0, moment#diff returned rounded number, not a rounded down number.

var a = moment([2008, 6]);
var b = moment([2007, 0]);
a.diff(b, 'years');       // 1
a.diff(b, 'years', true); // 1.5
If the moment is earlier than the moment you are passing to moment.fn.diff, the return value will be negative.

var a = moment();
var b = moment().add(1, 'seconds');
a.diff(b) // -1000
b.diff(a) // 1000
A easy way to think of this is by replacing .diff( with a minus operator.

          // a < b
a.diff(b) // a - b < 0
b.diff(a) // b - a > 0
Month and year diffs

moment#diff has some special handling for month and year diffs. It is optimized to ensure that two months with the same date are always a whole number apart.

So Jan 15 to Feb 15 should be exactly 1 month.

Feb 28 to Mar 28 should be exactly 1 month.

Feb 28 2011 to Feb 28 2012 should be exactly 1 year.

See more discussion on the month and year diffs here

This change to month and year diffs was made in 2.0.0. As of version 2.9.0 diff also support quarter unit.

Unix Offset (milliseconds) 1.0.0+

edit
moment().valueOf();
+moment();
moment#valueOf simply outputs the number of milliseconds since the Unix Epoch, just like Date#valueOf.

moment(1318874398806).valueOf(); // 1318874398806
+moment(1318874398806); // 1318874398806
To get a Unix timestamp (the number of seconds since the epoch) from a Moment, use moment#unix.

Unix Timestamp (seconds) 1.6.0+

edit
moment().unix();
moment#unix outputs a Unix timestamp (the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch).

moment(1318874398806).unix(); // 1318874398
This value is floored to the nearest second, and does not include a milliseconds component.

Days in Month 1.5.0+

edit
moment().daysInMonth();
Get the number of days in the current month.

moment("2012-02", "YYYY-MM").daysInMonth() // 29
moment("2012-01", "YYYY-MM").daysInMonth() // 31
As Javascript Date 1.0.0+

edit
moment().toDate();
To get the native Date object that Moment.js wraps, use moment#toDate.

This will return the Date that the moment uses, so any changes to that Date will cause the moment to change. If you want a Date that is a copy, use moment#clone before you use moment#toDate.

moment#native has been replaced by moment#toDate and has been deprecated as of 1.6.0.

As Array 1.7.0+

edit
moment().toArray();
This returns an array that mirrors the parameters from new Date().

moment().toArray(); // [2013, 1, 4, 14, 40, 16, 154];
As JSON 2.0.0+

edit
moment().toJSON();
When serializing an object to JSON, if there is a Moment object, it will be represented as an ISO8601 string, adjusted to UTC.

JSON.stringify({
    postDate : moment()
}); // '{"postDate":"2013-02-04T22:44:30.652Z"}'
If instead you would like an ISO8601 string that reflects the moment's utcOffset(), then you can modify the toJSON function like this:

moment.fn.toJSON = function() { return this.format(); }
This changes the behavior as follows:

JSON.stringify({
    postDate : moment()
}); // '{"postDate":"2013-02-04T14:44:30-08:00"}'
As ISO 8601 String 2.1.0+

edit
moment().toISOString();
Formats a string to the ISO8601 standard.

moment().toISOString() // 2013-02-04T22:44:30.652Z
From version 2.8.4 the native Date.prototype.toISOString is used if available, for performance reasons.

As Object 2.10.5+

edit
moment().toObject();
This returns an object containing year, month, day-of-month, hour, minute, seconds, milliseconds.

moment().toObject()  // {
                     //     years: 2015
                     //     months: 6
                     //     date: 26,
                     //     hours: 1,
                     //     minutes: 53,
                     //     seconds: 14,
                     //     milliseconds: 600
                     // }
Query
Is Before 2.0.0+

edit
moment().isBefore(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().isBefore(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, String);
Check if a moment is before another moment.

moment('2010-10-20').isBefore('2010-10-21'); // true
If you want to limit the granularity to a unit other than milliseconds, pass the units as the second parameter.

As the second parameter determines the precision, and not just a single value to check, using day will check for year, month and day.

moment('2010-10-20').isBefore('2010-12-31', 'year'); // false
moment('2010-10-20').isBefore('2011-01-01', 'year'); // true
Like moment#isAfter and moment#isSame, any of the units of time that are supported for moment#startOf are supported for moment#isBefore.

year month week day hour minute second
If nothing is passed to moment#isBefore, it will default to the current time.

NOTE: moment().isBefore() has undefined behavior and should not be used! If the code runs fast the initial created moment would be the same as the one created in isBefore to perform the check, so the result would be false. But if the code runs slower it's possible that the moment created in isBefore is measurably after the one created in moment(), so the call would return true.

Is Same 2.0.0+

edit
moment().isSame(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().isSame(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, String);
Check if a moment is the same as another moment.

moment('2010-10-20').isSame('2010-10-20'); // true
If you want to limit the granularity to a unit other than milliseconds, pass it as the second parameter.

moment('2010-10-20').isSame('2009-12-31', 'year');  // false
moment('2010-10-20').isSame('2010-01-01', 'year');  // true
moment('2010-10-20').isSame('2010-12-31', 'year');  // true
moment('2010-10-20').isSame('2011-01-01', 'year');  // false
When including a second parameter, it will match all units equal or larger. Passing in month will check month and year. Passing in day will check day, month, and year.

moment('2010-01-01').isSame('2011-01-01', 'month'); // false, different year
moment('2010-01-01').isSame('2010-02-01', 'day');   // false, different month
Like moment#isAfter and moment#isBefore, any of the units of time that are supported for moment#startOf are supported for moment#isSame.

year month week day hour minute second
Is After 2.0.0+

edit
moment().isAfter(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().isAfter(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, String);
Check if a moment is after another moment.

moment('2010-10-20').isAfter('2010-10-19'); // true
If you want to limit the granularity to a unit other than milliseconds, pass the units as the second parameter.

As the second parameter determines the precision, and not just a single value to check, using day will check for year, month and day.

moment('2010-10-20').isAfter('2010-01-01', 'year'); // false
moment('2010-10-20').isAfter('2009-12-31', 'year'); // true
Like moment#isSame and moment#isBefore, any of the units of time that are supported for moment#startOf are supported for moment#isAfter.

year month week day hour minute second
If nothing is passed to moment#isAfter, it will default to the current time.

moment().isAfter(); // false
Is Between 2.9.0+

edit
moment().isBetween(moment-like, moment-like);
moment().isBetween(moment-like, moment-like, String);
// where moment-like is Moment|String|Number|Date|Array
Check if a moment is between two other moments, optionally looking at unit scale (minutes, hours, days, etc). The match is exclusive.

moment('2010-10-20').isBetween('2010-10-19', '2010-10-25'); // true
If you want to limit the granularity to a unit other than milliseconds, pass the units as the second parameter.

moment('2010-10-20').isBetween('2010-01-01', '2012-01-01', 'year'); // false
moment('2010-10-20').isBetween('2009-12-31', '2012-01-01', 'year'); // true
Like moment#isSame, moment#isBefore, moment#isAfter any of the units of time that are supported for moment#startOf are supported for moment#isBetween. Year, month, week, day, hour, minute, and second.

Is Leap Year 1.0.0+

edit
moment().isLeapYear();
moment#isLeapYear returns true if that year is a leap year, and false if it is not.

moment([2000]).isLeapYear() // true
moment([2001]).isLeapYear() // false
moment([2100]).isLeapYear() // false
Is Daylight Saving Time 1.2.0+

edit
moment().isDST();
moment#isDST checks if the current moment is in daylight saving time.

moment([2011, 2, 12]).isDST(); // false, March 12 2011 is not DST
moment([2011, 2, 14]).isDST(); // true, March 14 2011 is DST
Is DST Shifted 2.3.0+

edit
moment('2013-03-10 2:30', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm').isDSTShifted()
Another important piece of validation is to know if the date has been moved by a DST. For example, in most of the United States:

moment('2013-03-10 2:30', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm').format(); //=> '2013-03-10T01:30:00-05:00'
This is because daylight saving time shifts the time from 2:00 to 3:00, so 2:30 isn't a real time. The resulting time is browser-dependent, either adjusting the time forward or backwards. Use moment#isDSTShifted to test for this condition.

Note: before 2.3.0, Moment objects in this condition always returned false for moment#isValid; they now return true.

Is a Moment 1.5.0+

edit
moment.isMoment(obj);
To check if a variable is a moment object, use moment.isMoment().

moment.isMoment() // false
moment.isMoment(new Date()) // false
moment.isMoment(moment()) // true
Is a Date 2.9.0+

edit
moment.isDate(obj);
To check if a variable is a native js Date object, use moment.isDate().

moment.isDate(); // false
moment.isDate(new Date()); // true
moment.isDate(moment()); // false
i18n
Moment.js has robust support for internationalization.

You can load multiple locales and easily switch between them.

In addition to assigning a global locale, you can assign a locale to a specific moment.

Changing locale globally 1.0.0+

By default, Moment.js comes with English locale strings. If you need other locales, you can load them into Moment.js for later use.

To load a locale, pass the key and the string values to moment.locale.

More details on each of the parts of the locale bundle can be found in the customization section.

});
Once you load a locale, it becomes the active locale. To change active locales, simply call moment.locale with the key of a loaded locale.

moment.locale('fr');
moment(1316116057189).fromNow() // il y a une heure
moment.locale('en');
moment(1316116057189).fromNow() // an hour ago
As of 2.8.0, changing the global locale doesn't affect existing instances.

moment.locale('fr');
var m = moment(1316116057189);
m.fromNow(); // il y a une heure

moment.locale('en');
m.fromNow(); // il y a une heure
moment(1316116057189).fromNow(); // an hour ago
moment.locale returns the locale used. This is useful because Moment won't change locales if it doesn't know the one you specify.

moment.locale('fr'); // 'fr'
moment.locale('tq'); // 'fr'
You may also specify a list of locales, and Moment will use the first one it has localizations for.

moment.locale(['tq', 'fr']); // 'fr'
Moment will also try locale specifier substrings from most-specific to least-specific until it finds a locale it knows. This is useful when supplying Moment with a locale string pulled from the user's environment, such as window.navigator.language.

moment.locale('en-NZ'); // 'en'
Finally, Moment will search intelligently through an array of locales and their substrings.

moment.locale('en-NZ', 'en-AU'); // 'en-au', not 'en'
Changing locales locally 1.7.0+

edit
// From version 2.8.1 onward
moment().locale(String);

// Deprecated version 2.8.1
moment().lang(String);
A global locale configuration can be problematic when passing around moments that may need to be formatted into different locale.

In 1.7.0 we added instance specific locale configurations.

moment.locale('en'); // default the locale to English
var localLocale = moment();

localLocale.locale('fr'); // set this instance to use French
localLocale.format('LLLL'); // dimanche 15 juillet 2012 11:01
moment().format('LLLL'); // Sunday, July 15 2012 11:01 AM

moment.locale('es'); // change the global locale to Spanish
localLocale.format('LLLL'); // dimanche 15 juillet 2012 11:01
moment().format('LLLL'); // Domingo 15 Julio 2012 11:01

localLocale.locale(false); // reset the instance locale
localLocale.format('LLLL'); // Domingo 15 Julio 2012 11:01
moment().format('LLLL'); // Domingo 15 Julio 2012 11:01
If you call moment#locale with no parameters, you get back the locale configuration that would be used for that moment.

var fr = moment().locale('fr');
fr.localeData().months(moment([2012, 0])) // "janvier"
fr.locale('en');
fr.localeData().months(moment([2012, 0])) // "January"
If you need to access the locale data for a moment, this is the preferred way to do so.

As of 2.3.0, you can also specify an array of locale identifiers. It works the same was it does in the global locale configuration.

Loading locales in NodeJS 1.0.0+

edit
moment.locale(String);
Loading locales in NodeJS is super easy. If there is a locale file in moment-root/locale/ named after that key, the first call to moment.locale will load it.

var moment = require('moment');
moment.locale('fr');
moment(1316116057189).fromNow(); // il y a une heure
If you want your locale supported, create a pull request to the develop branch with the required locale and unit test files.

Loading locales in the browser 1.0.0+

edit
// From 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale(String, Object);

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang(String, Object);
Loading locales in the browser just requires you to include the locale files.

<script src="moment.js"></script>
<script src="locale/fr.js"></script>
<script src="locale/pt.js"></script>
<script>
  moment.locale('fr');  // Set the default/global locale
  // ...
</script>
There are minified versions of all locales together:

<script src="moment.js"></script>
<script src="min/locales.js"></script>
To minimize http requests, use our Grunt task to compile Moment with a custom list of locales:

grunt transpile:fr,it
<script src="min/moment-with-locales.custom.js"></script>
Note: Locale files are defined in UMD style, so they should work seamlessly in all environments.

Adding your locale to Moment.js

edit
To add your locale to Moment.js, submit a pull request with both a locale file and a test file. You can find examples in moment/locale/fr.js and moment/test/locale/fr.js.

To run the tests in Node.js, do npm install, then grunt.

If all the tests pass, submit a pull request, and thank you for contributing!

Checking the current Moment.js locale 1.6.0+

edit
// From version 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale();

// Deprecated in version 2.8.1
moment.lang();
If you are changing locales frequently, you may want to know what locale is currently being used. This is as simple as calling moment.locale without any parameters.

moment.locale('en'); // set to english
moment.locale(); // returns 'en'
moment.locale('fr'); // set to french
moment.locale(); // returns 'fr'
Listing the months and weekdays of the current Moment.js locale 2.3.0+

edit
moment.months()
moment.monthsShort()
moment.weekdays()
moment.weekdaysShort()
moment.weekdaysMin()
It is sometimes useful to get the list of months or weekdays in a locale, for example when populating a dropdown menu.

moment.months();
Returns the list of months in the current locale.

[ 'January',
  'February',
  'March',
  'April',
  'May',
  'June',
  'July',
  'August',
  'September',
  'October',
  'November',
  'December' ]
Similarly, moment.monthsShort returns abbreviated month names, and moment.weekdays, moment.weekdaysShort, moment.weekdaysMin return lists of weekdays.

You can pass an integer into each of those functions to get a specific month or weekday.

moment.weekdays(3); // 'Wednesday'
Note: Currently, weekdays always have Sunday as index 0, regardless of the local first day of the week.

Some locales make special considerations into account when formatting month names. For example, Dutch formats month abbreviations without a trailing period, but only if it's formatting the month between dashes. The months method supports passing a format in so that the months will be listed in the proper context.

moment.locale('nl');
moment.monthsShort(); // ['jan.', 'feb.', 'mrt.', ...]
moment.monthsShort('-MMM-'); // [ 'jan', 'feb', 'mrt', ...]
And finally, you can combine both the format option and the integer option.

moment.monthsShort('-MMM-', 3); // 'apr'

You can access the properties of the currently loaded locale through the moment.localeData(key) function. It returns the current locale or a locale with the given key:

// get current locale
var currentLocaleData = moment.localeData();
var frLocaleData = moment.localeData('fr');
The returned object has the following methods:

localeData.months(aMoment);  // full month name of aMoment
localeData.monthsShort(aMoment);  // short month name of aMoment
localeData.monthsParse(longOrShortMonthString);  // returns month id (0 to 11) of input

localeData.weekdaysShort(aMoment);  // short weekday name of aMoment
localeData.weekdaysMin(aMoment);  // min weekday name of aMoment
localeData.weekdaysParse(minShortOrLongWeekdayString);  // returns weekday id (0 to 6) of input
localeData.longDateFormat(dateFormat);  // returns the full format of abbreviated date-time formats LT, L, LL and so on
localeData.isPM(amPmString);  // returns true iff amPmString represents PM
localeData.meridiem(hours, minutes, isLower);  // returns am/pm string for particular time-of-day in upper/lower case
localeData.calendar(key, aMoment);  // returns a format that would be used for calendar representation. Key is one of 'sameDay', 'nextDay', 'lastDay', 'nextWeek', 'prevWeek', 'sameElse'
localeData.relativeTime(number, withoutSuffix, key, isFuture);  // returns relative time string, key is on of 's', 'm', 'mm', 'h', 'hh', 'd', 'dd', 'M', 'MM', 'y', 'yy'. Single letter when number is 1.
localeData.pastFuture(diff, relTime);  // convert relTime string to past or future string depending on diff
localeData.ordinal(number);  // convert number to ordinal string 1 -> 1st
localeData.preparse(str);  // called before parsing on every input string
localeData.postformat(str);  // called after formatting on every string
localeData.week(aMoment);  // returns week-of-year of aMoment

localeData.firstDayOfWeek();  // 0-6 (Sunday to Saturday)
localeData.firstDayOfYear();  // 0-15 this and the first day of week are used
                              // to determine which is the first week of the

Customize
Moment.js is very easy to customize. In general, you should create a locale setting with your customizations.

moment.locale('en-my-settings', {
    // customizations.
});
However, you can also overwrite an existing locale that has been loaded as well.

moment.locale('en', {
    // customizations
});
Any settings that are not defined are inherited from the default english settings.

You can remove a previously defined locale by passing null as the second argument. The deleted locale will no longer be available for use.

moment.locale('fr'); // 'fr'
moment.locale('en'); // 'en'
moment.locale('fr', null);
moment.locale('fr'); // 'en'
Month Names 1.0.0+

edit
// From 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale('en', {
    months : String[]
});
moment.locale('en', {
    months : Function
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    months : String[]
});
moment.lang('en', {
    months : Function
});
Locale#months should be an array of the month names.

moment.locale('en', {
    months : [
        "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
        "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"
    ]
});
If you need more processing to calculate the name of the month, (for example, if there is different grammar for different formats), Locale#months can be a function with the following signature. It should always return a month name.

moment.locale('en', {
    months : function (momentToFormat, format) {
        // momentToFormat is the moment currently being formatted
        // format is the formatting string
        if (/^MMMM/.test(format)) { // if the format starts with 'MMMM'
            return nominative[momentToFormat.month()];
        } else {
            return subjective[momentToFormat.month()];
        }
    }

});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {

Locale#monthsShort should be an array of the month abbreviations.

moment.locale('en', {
    monthsShort : [
        "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
        "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
    ]
});
Like Locale#months, Locale#monthsShort can be a callback function as well.

moment.locale('en', {
    monthsShort : function (momentToFormat, format) {
        if (/^MMMM/.test(format)) {
            return nominative[momentToFormat.month()];
        } else {
            return subjective[momentToFormat.month()];

// Deprecated version 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {

Locale#weekdays should be an array of the weekdays names.

moment.locale('en', {
    weekdays : [
        "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"
    ]
});
Locale#weekdays can be a callback function as well.

moment.locale('en', {
    weekdays : function (momentToFormat, format) {
        return weekdays[momentToFormat.day()];
    }
});

Locale#weekdaysShort should be an array of the weekdays abbreviations.

moment.locale('en', {
    weekdaysShort : ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"]
});
Locale#weekdaysShort can be a callback function as well.

moment.locale('en', {
    weekdaysShort : function (momentToFormat, format) {
        return weekdaysShort[momentToFormat.day()];
    }
});
Minimal Weekday Abbreviations 1.7.0+

edit
// From 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale('en', {
    weekdaysMin : String[]

moment.locale('en', {

});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    weekdaysMin : String[]
});
moment.lang('en', {
    weekdaysMin : Function
});
Locale#weekdaysMin should be an array of two letter weekday abbreviations. The purpose of these is for things like calendar pickers, thus they should be as small as possible.

moment.locale('en', {
    weekdaysMin : ["Su", "Mo", "Tu", "We", "Th", "Fr", "Sa"]
});
Locale#weekdaysMin can be a callback function as well.

moment.locale('en', {
    weekdaysMin : function (momentToFormat, format) {
        return weekdaysMin[momentToFormat.day()];
    }
});
Long Date Formats 1.1.0+

edit
// From 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale('en', {
    longDateFormat : Object
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    longDateFormat : Object
});
Locale#longDateFormat should be an object containing a key/value pair for each long date format L LL LLL LLLL LT LTS. LT should be the time format, and is also used for moment#calendar.

moment.locale('en', {
    longDateFormat : {
        LT: "h:mm A",
        LTS: "h:mm:ss A",
        L: "MM/DD/YYYY",
        l: "M/D/YYYY",
        LL: "MMMM Do YYYY",
        ll: "MMM D YYYY",
        LLL: "MMMM Do YYYY LT",
        lll: "MMM D YYYY LT",
        LLLL: "dddd, MMMM Do YYYY LT",
        llll: "ddd, MMM D YYYY LT"
    }
});
You can eliminate the lowercase l tokens and they will be created automatically by replacing long tokens with the short token variants.

moment.locale('en', {
    longDateFormat : {
        LT: "h:mm A",
        LTS: "h:mm:ss A",
        L: "MM/DD/YYYY",
        LL: "MMMM Do YYYY",
        LLL: "MMMM Do YYYY LT",
        LLLL: "dddd, MMMM Do YYYY LT"
    }
});
Relative Time 1.0.0+

edit
// From 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale('en', {
    relativeTime : Object
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    relativeTime : Object
});
Locale#relativeTime should be an object of the replacement strings for moment#from.

moment.locale('en', {
    relativeTime : {
        future: "in %s",
        past:   "%s ago",
        s:  "seconds",
        m:  "a minute",
        mm: "%d minutes",
        h:  "an hour",
        hh: "%d hours",
        d:  "a day",
        dd: "%d days",
        M:  "a month",
        MM: "%d months",
        y:  "a year",
        yy: "%d years"
    }
});
Locale#relativeTime.future refers to the prefix/suffix for future dates, and Locale#relativeTime.past refers to the prefix/suffix for past dates. For all others, a single character refers to the singular, and a double character refers to the plural.

If a locale requires additional processing for a token, it can set the token as a function with the following signature. The function should return a string.

function (number, withoutSuffix, key, isFuture) {
    return string;
}
The key argument refers to the replacement key in the Locale#relativeTime object. (eg. s m mm h, etc.)

The number argument refers to the number of units for that key. For m, the number is the number of minutes, etc.

The withoutSuffix argument will be true if the token will be displayed without a suffix, and false if it will be displayed with a suffix. (The reason for the inverted logic is because the default behavior is to display with the suffix.)

The isFuture argument will be true if it is going to use the future suffix/prefix and false if it is going to use the past prefix/suffix. The isFuture argument was added in version 1.6.0.

AM/PM 1.6.0+

edit
// From 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale('en', {
    meridiem : Function
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    meridiem : Function
});
If your locale uses 'am/pm', Locale#meridiem can be omitted, as those values are the defaults.

If your locale needs any different computation for am/pm, Locale#meridiem should be a callback function that returns the correct string based on hour, minute, and upper/lowercase.

moment.locale('zh-cn', {
    meridiem : function (hour, minute, isLowercase) {
        if (hour < 9) {
            return "早上";
        } else if (hour < 11 && minute < 30) {
            return "上午";
        } else if (hour < 13 && minute < 30) {
            return "中午";
        } else if (hour < 18) {
            return "下午";
        } else {
            return "晚上";
        }
    }
});
Before version 1.6.0, Locale#meridiem was a map of upper and lowercase versions of am/pm.

moment.locale('en', {
    meridiem : {
        am : 'am',
        AM : 'AM',
        pm : 'pm',
        PM : 'PM'
    }
});
This has been deprecated. The 1.6.0 callback function syntax is now used instead.

AM/PM Parsing 2.1.0+

edit
// From 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale('en', {
    meridiemParse : RegExp
    isPM : Function
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    meridiemParse : RegExp
    isPM : Function
});
Locale#isPM should return true if the input string is past 12 noon. This is used in parsing the a A tokens.

moment.locale('en', {
    isPM : function (input) {
        return ((input + '').toLowerCase()[0] === 'p');
    }
});
To configure what strings should be parsed as input, set the meridiemParse property.

moment.locale('en', {
    meridiemParse : /[ap]\.?m?\.?/i
});
Calendar 1.3.0+

edit
// From 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale('en', {
    calendar : Object
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    calendar : Object
});
Locale#calendar should have the following formatting strings.

moment.locale('en', {
    calendar : {
        lastDay : '[Yesterday at] LT',
        sameDay : '[Today at] LT',
        nextDay : '[Tomorrow at] LT',
        lastWeek : '[last] dddd [at] LT',
        nextWeek : 'dddd [at] LT',
        sameElse : 'L'
    }
});
Each of the Locale#calendar keys can also be a callback function with the scope of the current moment. It should return a formatting string.

function () {
    return '[hoy a la' + ((this.hours() !== 1) ? 's' : '') + '] LT';
},
Ordinal 1.0.0+

edit
// From 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale('en', {
    ordinal : Function
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    ordinal : Function
});
Locale#ordinal should be a function that returns the ordinal for a given number.

moment.locale('en', {
    ordinal : function (number, token) {
        var b = number % 10;
        var output = (~~ (number % 100 / 10) === 1) ? 'th' :
            (b === 1) ? 'st' :
            (b === 2) ? 'nd' :
            (b === 3) ? 'rd' : 'th';
        return number + output;
    }
});
As of 2.0.0, the ordinal function should return both the number and the ordinal. Previously, only the ordinal was returned.

As of 2.1.0, the token parameter was added. It is a string of the token that is being ordinalized, for example: M or d.

For more information on ordinal numbers, see wikipedia

Relative Time Thresholds 2.7.0+

edit
moment.relativeTimeThreshold(unit);  // getter
moment.relativeTimeThreshold(unit, limit);  // setter
duration.humanize has thresholds which define when a unit is considered a minute, an hour and so on. For example, by default more than 45 seconds is considered a minute, more than 22 hours is considered a day and so on. To change those cutoffs use moment.relativeTimeThreshold(unit, limit) where limit is one of s, m, h, d, M.

unit	meaning	usage
s	seconds	least number of seconds to be considered a minute
m	minutes	least number of minutes to be considered an hour
h	hours	least number of hours to be considered a day
d	days	least number of days to be considered a month
M	months	least number of months to be considered a year
  // Retrieve existing thresholds
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('s');  // 45
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('m');  // 45
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('h');  // 22
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('d');  // 26
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('M');  // 11

  // Set new thresholds
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('s', 40);
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('m', 40);
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('h', 20);
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('d', 25);
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('M', 10);
NOTE: Retrieving thresholds was added in 2.8.1.

Durations
Moment.js also has duration objects. Where a moment is defined as single points in time, durations are defined as a length of time.

Durations do not have a defined beginning and end date. They are contextless.

A duration is conceptually more similar to '2 hours' than to 'between 2 and 4 pm today'. As such, they are not a good solution to converting between units that depend on context.

For example, a year can be defined as 366 days, 365 days, 365.25 days, 12 months, or 52 weeks. Trying to convert years to days makes no sense without context. It is much better to use moment#diff for calculating days or years between two moments than to use Durations.

Creating 1.6.0+

edit
moment.duration(Number, String);
moment.duration(Number);
moment.duration(Object);
moment.duration(String);
To create a duration, call moment.duration() with the length of time in milliseconds.

moment.duration(100); // 100 milliseconds
If you want to create a moment with a unit of measurement other than milliseconds, you can pass the unit of measurement as well.

moment.duration(2, 'seconds');
moment.duration(2, 'minutes');
moment.duration(2, 'hours');
moment.duration(2, 'days');
moment.duration(2, 'weeks');
moment.duration(2, 'months');
moment.duration(2, 'years');
The same shorthand for moment#add and moment#subtract works here as well.

Key	Shorthand
years	y
months	M
weeks	w
days	d
hours	h
minutes	m
seconds	s
milliseconds	ms
Much like moment#add, you can pass an object of values if you need multiple different units of measurement.

moment.duration({
    seconds: 2,
    minutes: 2,
    hours: 2,
    days: 2,
    weeks: 2,
    months: 2,
    years: 2
});
As of 2.1.0, moment supports parsing ASP.NET style time spans. The following formats are supported.

The format is an hour, minute, second string separated by colons like 23:59:59. The number of days can be prefixed with a dot separator like so 7.23:59:59. Partial seconds are supported as well 23:59:59.999.

moment.duration('23:59:59');
moment.duration('23:59:59.999');
moment.duration('7.23:59:59.999');
moment.duration('23:59');          //added in 2.3.0
As of 2.3.0, moment also supports parsing ISO 8601 durations.

moment.duration('P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S');
moment.duration('P1M');
Humanize 1.6.0+

edit
moment.duration().humanize();
Sometimes, you want all the goodness of moment#from but you don't want to have to create two moments, you just want to display a length of time.

Enter moment.duration().humanize().

moment.duration(1, "minutes").humanize(); // a minute
moment.duration(2, "minutes").humanize(); // 2 minutes
moment.duration(24, "hours").humanize();  // a day
By default, the return string is suffixless. If you want a suffix, pass in true as seen below.

moment.duration(1, "minutes").humanize(true); // in a minute
For suffixes before now, pass in a negative number.

moment.duration(-1, "minutes").humanize(true); // a minute ago
Milliseconds 1.6.0+

edit
moment.duration().milliseconds();
moment.duration().asMilliseconds();
To get the number of milliseconds in a duration, use moment.duration().milliseconds().

It will return a number between 0 and 999.

moment.duration(500).milliseconds(); // 500
moment.duration(1500).milliseconds(); // 500
moment.duration(15000).milliseconds(); // 0
If you want the length of the duration in milliseconds, use moment.duration().asMilliseconds() instead.

moment.duration(500).asMilliseconds(); // 500
moment.duration(1500).asMilliseconds(); // 1500
moment.duration(15000).asMilliseconds(); // 15000
Seconds 1.6.0+

edit
moment.duration().seconds();
moment.duration().asSeconds();
To get the number of seconds in a duration, use moment.duration().seconds().

It will return a number between 0 and 59.

moment.duration(500).seconds(); // 0
moment.duration(1500).seconds(); // 1
moment.duration(15000).seconds(); // 15
If you want the length of the duration in seconds, use moment.duration().asSeconds() instead.

moment.duration(500).asSeconds(); // 0.5
moment.duration(1500).asSeconds(); // 1.5
moment.duration(15000).asSeconds(); // 15
Minutes 1.6.0+

edit
moment.duration().minutes();
moment.duration().asMinutes();
As with the other getters for durations, moment.duration().minutes() gets the minutes (0 - 59).

moment.duration().asMinutes() gets the length of the duration in minutes.

Hours 1.6.0+

edit
moment.duration().hours();
moment.duration().asHours();
As with the other getters for durations, moment.duration().hours() gets the hours (0 - 23).

moment.duration().asHours() gets the length of the duration in hours.

Days 1.6.0+

edit
moment.duration().days();
moment.duration().asDays();
As with the other getters for durations, moment.duration().days() gets the days (0 - 29).

moment.duration().asDays() gets the length of the duration in days.

Months 1.6.0+

edit
moment.duration().months();
moment.duration().asMonths();
As with the other getters for durations, moment.duration().months() gets the months (0 - 11).

moment.duration().asMonths() gets the length of the duration in months.

Note: The length of a duration in months is defined as 30 days.

Years 1.6.0+

edit
moment.duration().years();
moment.duration().asYears();
As with the other getters for durations, moment.duration().years() gets the years.

moment.duration().asYears() gets the length of the duration in years.

Note: The length of a duration in years is defined as 365 days.

Add Time 2.1.0+

edit
moment.duration().add(Number, String);
moment.duration().add(Number);
moment.duration().add(Duration);
moment.duration().add(Object);
Mutates the original duration by adding time.

The same keys and shorthands used to create durations can be used here as the second argument.

var a = moment.duration(1, 'd');
var b = moment.duration(2, 'd');
a.add(b).days(); // 3
Subtract Time 2.1.0+

edit
moment.duration().subtract(Number, String);
moment.duration().subtract(Number);
moment.duration().subtract(Duration);
moment.duration().subtract(Object);
Mutates the original duration by subtracting time.

The same keys and shorthands used to create durations can be used here as the second argument.

var a = moment.duration(3, 'd');
var b = moment.duration(2, 'd');
a.subtract(b).days(); // 1
As Unit of Time 2.1.0+

edit
moment.duration().as(String);
As an alternate to Duration#asX, you can use Duration#as('x'). All the shorthand keys from moment#add apply here as well.

duration.as('hours');
duration.as('minutes');
duration.as('seconds');
duration.as('milliseconds');
Get Unit of Time 2.1.0+

edit
moment.duration().get(String);
As an alternate to Duration#x() getters, you can use Duration#get('x'). All the shorthand keys from moment#add apply here as well.

duration.get('hours');
duration.get('minutes');
duration.get('seconds');
duration.get('milliseconds');
As JSON 2.9.0+

edit
moment.duration().toJSON();
When serializing a duration object to JSON, it will be be represented as an ISO8601 string.

JSON.stringify({
    postDuration : moment.duration(5, 'm')
}); // '{"postDuration":"PT5M"}'
Is a Duration 1.6.0+

edit
moment.isDuration(obj);
To check if a variable is a moment duration object, use moment.isDuration().

moment.isDuration() // false
moment.isDuration(new Date()) // false
moment.isDuration(moment()) // false
moment.isDuration(moment.duration()) // true
moment.isDuration(moment.duration(2, 'minutes')) // true
Utilities
Moment exposes some methods which may be useful to people extending the library or writing custom parsers.

Normalize Units 2.3.0+

edit
moment.normalizeUnits(String);
Many of Moment's functions allow the caller to pass in aliases for unit enums. For example, all of the gets below are equivalent.

var m = moment();
m.get('y');
m.get('year');
m.get('years');
If you're extending the library, you may want access to Moment's facilities for that in order to better align your functionality with Moment's.

moment.normalizeUnits('y');      // 'year'
moment.normalizeUnits('Y');      // 'year'
moment.normalizeUnits('year');   // 'year'
moment.normalizeUnits('years');  // 'year'
moment.normalizeUnits('YeARS');  // 'year'
Invalid 2.3.0+

edit
moment.invalid(Object);
You can create your own invalid Moment objects, which is useful in making your own parser.

var m = moment.invalid();
m.isValid();                      // false
m.format();                       // 'Invalid date'
m.parsingFlags().userInvalidated; // true
invalid also accepts an object which specifies which parsing flags to set. This will not set the userInvalidated parsing flag unless it's one of the properties specified.

var m = moment.invalid({invalidMonth: 'Actober'});
m.parsingFlags().invalidMonth; // 'Actober'
You need not specify parsing flags recognized by Moment; the Moment will be invalid nonetheless, and the parsing flags will be returned by parsingFlags().

Plugins
Some other people have made plugins for Moment.js that may be useful to you.

Strftime

edit
npm install moment-strftime
If you are more comfortable working with strftime instead of LDML-like parsing tokens, you can use Ben Oakes' plugin moment-strftime.

The repository is located at github.com/benjaminoakes/moment-strftime

ISO Calendar

edit
npm install moment-isocalendar
If you are looking for a Python-like isocalendar method, you can use Rocky Meza's plugin

moment-isocalendar

Calling the isocalendar method on a moment will return an array like the following:

[year, week_of_year, day_of_week, minutes_since_midnight]

moment().isocalendar(); // [2012, 8, 5, 870]
You can also reconstruct a moment from a isocalendar array.

moment.fromIsocalendar([2011, 51, 5, 870]).format('LLLL');
// "Friday, December 23 2011 2:30 PM"
The repository is located at github.com/fusionbox/moment-isocalendar

Date Ranges

edit
npm install moment-range
If you need to work with date ranges, you can use Gianni Chiappetta's plugin moment-range.

Documentation can be found on the homepage github.com/gf3/moment-range.

And it is also available for the web at the repository below.

The repository is located at github.com/gf3/moment-range

Twix

edit
npm install twix
Another range plugin is Isaac Cambron's library Twix. It has many range-related features and excels at formatting ranges readably. For example,

var t = moment("1/25/1982 9:30 AM").twix("1/25/1982 1:30 PM");
t.isCurrent(); // false
t.count('minutes'); // 241
t.format();  // 'Jan 25, 1982, 9:30 AM - 1:30 PM'
t.simpleFormat("h:m"); // '9:30 - 1:30'
Full documentation of all the options and features is here.

It's available on npm like so:

npm install twix
Or just grab the JS file from here.

Twitter

edit
If you're trying to format times for tweets like the way Twitter does, you can use the moment.twitter plugin by @hijonathan.

It's a simple way to display both short and long versions of human-readable timestamps.

moment().subtract(5, 'hours').twitterLong();
// 5 hours
Yes, it does smart pluralization.

moment().subtract(1, 'hour').twitterLong();
// 1 hour
Not short enough for you?

moment().subtract(6, 'days').twitterShort();
// 6d
Jalaali Calendar

edit
npm install moment-jalaali
If you want to work with Jalaali calendar system (Jalali, Persian, Khorshidi or Shamsi), you can use Behrang Noruzi Niya's plugin moment-jalaali.

When installed, it will wrap moment and moment will be able to format and parse Jalaali years and months. Here is a short example:

var m = moment('1360/5/26', 'jYYYY/jM/jD'); // Parse a Jalaali date.
m.format('jYYYY/jM/jD [is] YYYY/M/D'); // 1360/5/26 is 1981/8/17
The repository is located at github.com/behrang/moment-jalaali.

MSDate

edit
If you are using OLE Automation dates in .NET check out Markit On Demand's moment-msdate. Using this plugin allows you to format OA dates into JavaScript dates and vice-versa.

Convert a moment to an OA date:

moment().toOADate(); // a floating point number
Or, convert an OA date to a moment:

moment.fromOADate(41493); // Wed Aug 07 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (MDT)
More information and detailed docs can be found on GitHub at http://markitondemand.github.io/moment-msdate/.

Fiscal Quarters

edit
If you ever have need for Fiscal, Calendar or Academic quarters, you can use the moment-fquarter plugin by @robgallen.

At its simplest, just call the fquarter method on any moment object. It returns a formatted string with April being the first quarter.

moment("2013-01-01").fquarter();
// Q4 2012/13
You can pass in any month as the starting quarter, e.g. July

moment("2013-01-01").fquarter(7);
// Q3 2012/13
If you want calendar quarters, start in January

moment("2013-01-01").fquarter(1);
// Q1 2013
Precise Range

edit
The Precise Range plugin, written by Rob Dawson, can be used to display exact, human-readable representations of date/time ranges

moment("2014-01-01 12:00:00").preciseDiff("2015-03-04 16:05:06");
 // 1 year 2 months 3 days 4 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds
moment.preciseDiff("2014-01-01 12:00:00", "2014-04-20 12:00:00");
// 3 months 19 days
Recur

edit
npm install moment-recur
If you need to work with recurring dates, you can use Casey Trimm's plugin moment-recur.

This plugin will allow you to create length-based intervals (days, weeks, etc.) and calendar-based intervals (daysOfMonth, monthsOfYear, etc.).

It provides a matches function to test whether a date recurs according to the rules set, as well as generator functions to get the next and previous dates in a series.

The repository, documentation, and many more examples can be found at github.com/c-trimm/moment-recur

var interval = moment( "01/01/2014" ).recur().every(2).days(); // Length Interval
interval.matches( "01/03/2014" ); // true
interval.next( 2, "L" ); // ["01/03/2014", "01/05/2014"]
interval.forget( "days" ); // Remove a rule
interval.dayOfMonth( 10 ); // Calendar Interval
interval.matches( "05/10/2014" ); // true
interval.previous( 2, "L" ); // ["12/10/2013", "11/10/2013"]
Parse Date Format

edit
npm install moment-parseformat
This plugin extracts the format of a date/time string.

var format = moment.parseFormat('Thursday, February 6th, 2014 9:20pm');
// dddd, MMMM Do, YYYY h:mma
moment().format(format); // format
That allows to create smart date inputs that let your users set a Date/Time and lets you extract the user's preferred format for future usage. Find an example usage of it at minutes.io.

The Plugin has been authored by @gr2m. Links: Demo | Source

Java DateFormat Parser

edit
npm install moment-jdateformatparser
If you want to work with the java.text.DateFormat you can use this plugin.

For example,

moment("2013-12-24 14:30").formatWithJDF("dd.MM.yyyy");  // returns the formatted date "24.12.2013"
moment().toJDFString("DD.MM.YYYY");  // returns the Java format pattern "dd.MM.yyyy"
The repository is located at github.com/MadMG/moment-jdateformatparser

Hijri Calendar

edit
npm install moment-hijri
If you want to work with Hijri calendar then you can use moment-hijri plugin. moment-hijri is a moment plugin for the Hijri lunar calendar based on Umm al-Qura calculations. This plugin is developed by Suhail Alkowaileet.

When you install it, it will wrap moment and you will be able to parse Hijri dates. Here is a short example:

m = moment('1410/8/28', 'iYYYY/iM/iD'); // Parse a Hijri date.
m.format('iYYYY/iM/iD [is] YYYY/M/D'); // 1410/8/28 is 1990/3/25
The repository is located at github.com/xsoh/moment-hijri.

Transform

edit
bower install moment-transform
moment-transform is a plugin that manipulated dates through patterns. You can use basic operations –set/add/substract– on individual parts (hours, month, …) of a Moment instance.

moment().transform('YYYY-MM-+01 00:00:00.000'); // Tonight at midnight
moment().transform('14:30:00.000'); // Today, 2:30 pm
moment().transform('YYYY-MM--30 00:00:00.000'); // 30 days ago
Optional parameters lets you specify custom patterns and force strict pattern usage (non-alphabetic characters are not mandatory in passed string by default).

moment().transform('+01MMYYYY', 'DD/MM/YYYY', false); // Tomorrow, same time
moment().transform('+01MMYYYY', 'DD/MM/YYYY', true); // Invalid date
You can see it live there while the repository is here.
